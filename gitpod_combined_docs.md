# Bitbucket Server

Gitpod works with public, private, or internal repositories on your own instance of [Bitbucket Server](https://bitbucket.org/product/guides/getting-started/overview#bitbucket-software-hosting-options) v7.20 or later. Setting this up requires 2 steps.

1. A one-time registration of the Bitbucket server instance with Gitpod.
2. Each Gitpod user connects their account to Bitbucket server the first time they start a workspace.

## Registering a Bitbucket Server

The Bitbucket Server Admin can register the Bitbucket Server in their own Gitpod [account settings](https://gitpod.io/integrations).

Start by creating a **New Integration** and entering the **Provider Host Name** of Bitbucket Server.

![Gitpod New Git Integration form](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-new-integration.png)

Copy the **Redirect URL** from the form above.

Open your Bitbucket Server Administration settings in another browser tab, and create a new incoming link for an external application.

![Bitbucket Server new OAuth2 application link](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-new-incoming-link.png)

Configure the link with the required fields, including the redirect URL copied above, and choose "Projects Admin" permissions.

![Bitbucket Server configure OAuth2 application link](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-configure-incoming-link.png)

Saving the configuration opens a settings page where you can copy the OAuth **Client ID** and a **Client secret**.

![Bitbucket Server new OAuth client ID and secret](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-oauth-client-id-and-secret.png)

Copy the **Client ID** and **Secret** into the corresponding fields in the new Gitpod integration form, and activate the integration.

Refreshing the integration settings page should show a new Git provider connection to your Bitbucket Server in addition to the Git Integration registration below that.

![Bitbucket Server integration and connection in Gitpod settings](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-integration-and-connection.png)

## Connecting Gitpod accounts to Bitbucket Server

Other Bitbucket Server users need to connect their own Gitpod account to their own Bitbucket Server account by starting a workspace.

To start a workspace, paste the URL of a Bitbucket Server repository into the New Workspace popup (<Keybind>CtrlCmd + O</Keybind>) in Gitpod, or prefix the repository URL as described in [Getting started](/docs/introduction/getting-started).

![Open in Gitpod form](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-open-in-gitpod.png)

The first time you do this, you'll be prompted to authorize with your Bitbucket Server instance.

![Prompt to authorize with Bitbucket Server](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-auth-prompt.png)

The Bitbucket Server OAuth window will prompt for confirmation to access projects and repositories.

![OAuth confirmation from Bitbucket Server](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-oauth-popup.png)

Once confirmed, the connection will be saved, and the workspace should open. Subsequent workspaces with repositories from the same Bitbucket Server instance should open without reconnecting.

## Creating a project in Gitpod

To create a new project with a Bitbucket Server repository in Gitpod, select your Bitbucket Server instance from the list of git providers.

![New project with Bitbucket Server](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-new-project.png)

You should see your own repositories and those for all projects to which you have access. Use the dropdown to switch between your personal account and other projects.

![New project select Bitbucket Server repo](../../../static/images/integrations/bbs-new-project-select-repo.png)

Selecting the repository will install a webhook and enable automatic prebuilds for the project.

# Bitbucket

Gitpod works with any public or private repository on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

To start a workspace from a Bitbucket project, prefix the Bitbucket project URL with `gitpod.io/#` as described in [Getting started](/docs/introduction/getting-started) or use the [browser extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension) to add a convenient Gitpod button to every Bitbucket page.

## Enable Prebuilds

All prebuilds require a [Gitpod project](/docs/configure/projects#add-a-new-project) for the repository.

To enable [prebuilt workspaces](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) for your Bitbucket project, you need to grant the `webhook` permission in Gitpod's [Integration Settings](https://gitpod.io/integrations) page. This allows Gitpod to install a webhook which creates a new prebuild for every push event.

# GitHub Enterprise

Gitpod works with public, private, or internal repositories on your own instance of [GitHub Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-github-enterprise-server) (GHE). Setting this up requires 2 steps.

1. A one-time registration of the GHE server with Gitpod.
2. Each Gitpod user connects their account to GHE the first time they start a workspace.

## Registering a GitHub Enterprise Server

The GHE Admin can register the GHE server in their own Gitpod [account settings](https://gitpod.io/integrations).

Start by creating a **New Integration** and entering the **Provider Host Name** of GHE server.

![Gitpod New Git Integration form](../../../static/images/integrations/new-git-integration-form.png)

Copy the **Redirect URL** from the form above.

Create a new OAuth application in your GHE developer settings, and fill in the **Authorization callback URL** with the copied value.

![GitHub Enterprise register new OAuth application form](../../../static/images/integrations/github-new-oauth-application.png)

Populate the remaining fields and register the application in GHE. This opens a settings page where you can copy the OAuth **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**.

![GitHub Enterprise new OAuth client ID and secret](../../../static/images/integrations/github-oauth-client-id-and-secret.png)

Copy the **Client ID** and **Secret** into the corresponding fields in Gitpod and activate the integration.

## Connecting Gitpod accounts to GHE

GHE users connect their Gitpod account to their GHE account by starting a workspace.

To start a workspace, paste the URL of a GHE repository into the New Workspace popup (<Keybind>CtrlCmd + O</Keybind>) in Gitpod, or prefix the repository URL as described in [Getting started](/docs/introduction/getting-started).

![Open in Gitpod form](../../../static/images/integrations/open-in-gitpod.png)

The first time you do this, you will be prompted to authorize with your GHE instance.

![Prompt to authorize with GitHub Enterprise](../../../static/images/integrations/github-enterprise-auth-prompt.png)

The GHE OAuth window will appear, showing the name of the registered Gitpod OAuth app.

![OAuth confirmation from GitHub Enterprise](../../../static/images/integrations/github-enterprise-oauth-popup.png)

If you are trying to open a private or internal repository in GHE, you will be prompted to grant additional authorization before the workspace starts.

![Private repo OAuth authorization from GitHub Enterprise](../../../static/images/integrations/github-enterprise-private-repo-scope-authorization.png)

## Validating your GHE connection with Gitpod

You should see the connection to your GHE instance, with your GHE account ID, in your Gitpod [integration settings](https://gitpod.io/integrations)

![GitHub Enterprise connection in Gitpod integration settings](../../../static/images/integrations/github-enterprise-connection.png)

If necessary, you can modify your GHE OAuth permissions to allow private repository access using the context menu on the right.

![Gitpod settings for GitHub integration permissions](../../../static/images/integrations/github-oauth-permissions.png)

## Creating a project in Gitpod

To create a new project with a GHE repository in Gitpod, select the your GHE instance from the list of git providers.

![New project with GitHub Enterprise](../../../static/images/integrations/new-project-with-github-enterprise.png)

You should see your own repositories and those for all organizations to which you have access. Use the dropdown to switch between your personal account and other organization accounts. No additional GitHub app installation is required for each organization.

![New project select GitHub Enterprise repo](../../../static/images/integrations/new-project-select-github-enterprise-repo.png)

Selecting the repository will install a webhook and enable automatic prebuilds for the project.

# GitHub

Gitpod works well with public or private repositories from [github.com](https://github.com/).

The first time you login to Gitpod with GitHub, you will be prompted to "Authorize Gitpod" to access your GitHub account. This creates a connection between Gitpod and your GitHub account, and installs an OAuth App in your GitHub [settings](https://github.com/settings/applications).

Gitpod uses the name and email from your GitHub account ID to create a new Gitpod user account. This is sufficient to start a Gitpod workspace on a public repository.

![GitHub prompt for Gitpod OAuth App permissions with user:email scope](../../../static/images/integrations/github-oauth-install.png)

## Starting Workspaces

To start a new workspace after logging into Gitpod, use <Keybind>CtrlCmd + O</Keybind> or click on the **New Workspace** button in https://gitpod.io/workspaces. This will prompt for a repository URL, or suggest recent repositories opened with your account.

You can also start a Gitpod workspace using a GitHub repository URL. Simply point your browser to the repository URL prefixed with `gitpod.io/#` as described in [Getting started](/docs/introduction/getting-started).

## Granting additional GitHub OAuth permissions

GitHub requires `repo` scope permissions to open a workspace on a private repository, or to push code changes from a workspace back to your repository.

You can grant these additional permissions for GitHub at https://gitpod.io/integrations using the context menu on the right.

![Gitpod settings for GitHub integration permissions](../../../static/images/integrations/github-oauth-permissions.png)

## Authorizing GitHub webhooks

The first time you create a new Gitpod [project](/docs/configure/projects) you will need to configure our [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io) to watch your repositories and trigger prebuilds.

> NOTE: Installing the GitHub App for webhooks is only required for github.com, not for [GitHub Enterprise](/docs/configure/authentication/github-enterprise) or other git providers.

![Gitpod new project prompt for GitHub App authorization](../../../static/images/integrations/github-new-project-install-app.png)

The App must be installed on every GitHub user or organization account with repositories used in a Gitpod project. This allows you to grant permissions for all repositories or select repo-by-repo.

![GitHub App repo authorization](../../../static/images/integrations/github-app-authorize-repos.png)

## Errors with private repositories on GitHub orgs

If you encounter errors setting up a Gitpod project on a private repository in a GitHub org, you may need to approve the Gitpod OAuth app for 3rd party access to the org.

1. In https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/484069277e293e6d2a2a.
2. Look for the org in question in the lower section of the page under 'Organization access'.
3. Click on the Grant button.

</script>

# GitLab

Gitpod works nicely with GitLab: You can start Gitpod workspaces directly from the web pages of your GitLab repositories, and you can configure Gitpod to automatically prebuild these workspaces such that you can start coding on any branch in no time.

To use Gitpod on GitLab repositories, you have to link your GitLab account to Gitpod. Gitpod redirects you to GitLab's authentication workflow when needed. Alternatively, you might want to connect your [GitLab account manually](#connecting-your-gitlab-account).

All of this is already pre-configured for `GitLab.com` (the SaaS version), and can easily be set up for [self-hosted GitLab installations](#registering-a-self-hosted-gitlab-installation).

## Starting Workspaces

You can start a Gitpod workspace directly from the web pages of a GitLab repository. Simply click on the dropdown arrow next to the _Web IDE_ split button on the project or merge request page, and choose _Gitpod_. The Gitpod workspace will open in a new browser tab. The next time you visit a GitLab page, the last used action will be pre-selected.

![GitLab Integration](../../../static/images/docs/beta/integrations/gitpod-button-project-page.png)

To launch new Gitpod workspaces for issues, branches, specific commits, etc. you can also prefix any GitLab URL with `gitpod.io/#` as described in the [Getting started](/docs/introduction/getting-started) page, or use the [browser extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension) to add a convenient _Gitpod_ button to every GitLab page.

## Enabling Prebuilds

All prebuilds require a [Gitpod project](/docs/configure/projects#add-a-new-project) for the repository.

To automatically create a [prebuilt workspace](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) for each commit, Gitpod needs access to install a webhook. To allow this, go to Gitpod's [Integrations](https://gitpod.io/integrations/) page, scroll to the "Git Providers" section, click on the three dot button that pops up when you hover over the "GitLab" entry. Then choose _Edit Permissions_ from the popup menu.

![GitLab integration actions menu](../../../static/images/docs/beta/integrations/gitlab-integration-actions-menu.png)

In the "Edit Permissions" dialog, make sure that _api_ is checked such that Gitpod is allowed to install the webhook.

![Modal Edit Permissions of GitLab in the Gitpod settings](../../../static/images/docs/beta/integrations/edit-permissions.png)

## Connecting Your GitLab Account

To use Gitpod on a GitLab repository, you have to connect your GitLab account with your Gitpod account. In the following, we assume that you already have a valid account on the GitLab instance you want to connect to.

Gitpod supports the following use cases:

- [GitLab](#GitLab)
  - [Starting Workspaces](#starting-workspaces)
  - [Enabling Prebuilds](#enabling-prebuilds)
  - [Connecting Your GitLab Account](#connecting-your-gitlab-account)
    - [Connecting Your GitLab.com Account](#connecting-your-gitlabcom-account)
    - [Connecting Your Self-Hosted GitLab Account](#connecting-your-self-hosted-gitlab-account)
    - [Disconnecting Your GitLab Account](#disconnecting-your-gitlab-account)
  - [Registering A Self-Hosted GitLab Installation](#registering-a-self-hosted-gitlab-installation)

### Connecting Your GitLab.com Account

If you have initially logged into Gitpod using `GitLab`, your Gitpod account is already connected to your `GitLab.com` account and you can skip this section.

If you have logged into Gitpod with a different provider, you can manually add your GitLab account as follows:

1. Open [the integrations page](https://gitpod.io/integrations/). Scroll to the section about "Git Providers" and click on the three dot button that pops up when you hover over the _GitLab_ item. Select _Connect_ from the popup menu.

![GitLab integration connect menu item](../../../static/images/docs/beta/integrations/gitlab-integration-connect-menu-item.png)

2. You will be redirected to GitLab's login page. Log in with your username and password or choose one of the OAuth providers from the list.

3. Once logged in successfully, you will be asked to authorize Gitpod to access your personal information on GitLab and use their API. Click _Authorize_.

![GitLab: Authorize Gitpod](../../../static/images/docs/beta/integrations/authorize-gitpod.png)

4. You'll be directed back to Gitpod's settings page. A green bullet left to _GitLab_ signals you've successfully linked your GitLab account with Gitpod.

![GitLab integration connected](../../../static/images/docs/beta/integrations/gitlab-integration-connected.png)

### Connecting Your Self-Hosted GitLab Account

A Self-Hosted GitLab installation has to be [registered to Gitpod](#registering-a-self-hosted-gitlab-installation) before it can be used. Once that's done, you can link your GitLab account on that installation to GitPod using the following steps:

1. Make sure you are logged into Gitpod.
2. In the same browser, open a new tab and navigate to a repository of the GitLab installation.
3. [Start a new Gitpod workspace](#starting-workspaces) on this repository.

### Disconnecting Your GitLab Account

To disconnect a GitLab account from your Gitpod account:

1. Open [the integrations page](https://gitpod.io/integrations/). Scroll to the section about "Git Providers" and click on the three dot button that pops up when you hover over the item of the GitLab provider you want to disconnect. Select _Disconnect_ from the popup menu.

This will only invalidate the current access token in Gitpod. To disable access for good you have to revoke the access to Gitpod on the GitLab side.

## Registering A Self-Hosted GitLab Installation

The SaaS service `GitLab.com` is already pre-configured in Gitpod. But if you are using a Self-Hosted GitLab installation, you have to register it in Gitpod before it can be used.

> Note that the registration has to be done by one Gitpod user only, and that the GitLab account of this user is automatically connected. All other users of the same GitLab installation should just [link to their GitLab accounts](#connecting-your-self-hosted-gitlab-account).

Here is how to register your Self-Hosted GitLab installation:

1. In your GitLab installation, enable the native Gitpod integration as described in the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/integration/gitpod.html). This needs administrator privileges on the GitLab installation.

2. Head over to [the integrations page](https://gitpod.io/integrations/) on Gitpod. Scroll to the section about `Git Integrations` and click on the "New Integration" button.

![Git Integrations section in the Gitpod settings](../../../static/images/docs/beta/integrations/git-integrations.png)

3. In the pop-up window, choose GitLab as the provider type and enter the URL of the GitLab installation you want to use.

![New Git integration dialog](../../../static/images/docs/beta/integrations/new-git-integration.png)

4. The next field in the form is the _redirect URL_ that you need to register Gitpod on the GitLab side. Copy the _redirect URL_ to your clipboard using the button on the right.

5. Go to `/profile/applications` on your GitLab installation to create an OAuth app. Type in a name (e.g. "Gitpod") and paste the _redirect URL_ in the corresponding text area. Check the scopes _api_ and _read_user_. Click the button _Save Application_ below.

<img alt="create new GitLab app" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/372735/91146315-04abe800-e6b7-11ea-87ff-e61f5a87861f.png">

6. Copy the _Application ID_ and the _Secret_ in the corresponding form fields (_Client ID_ resp. _Client Secret_) of your Gitpod installation.

<img alt="link new GitLab app to Gitpod" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/372735/91142160-9f54f880-e6b0-11ea-8436-6a9c8bc67d9f.png">

7. Press _Connect_ and go through the GitLab authentication flow to connect your user account.

## FAQs

### ["Email address already used in another account" when trying to login into Gitpod](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1015175207301947433)

<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

Send us a message through the [contact form](https://www.gitpod.io/contact/support) with your Gitpod account email. After you reach out, we will delete your account so that you can sign up again, which should resolve your issue.

### [How to get SCM API token from Gitpod's GitLab, GitHub or Bitbucket integration as environment variable](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1061997373817094236)

<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

Run `gp init` on your terminal or manually create a file called `.gitpod.yml`

- Put the following line in your `.gitpod.yml`:

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

- Create a file called `.gitpod.Dockerfile` and put the following content in it:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

RUN file="$HOME/.bashrc.d/770-scm_token.sh" \
    && printf '%s\n' 'if [[ "${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_URL:-}" == *gitlab* ]]; then : "gitlab"; else : "github"; fi; scm_name="$_"' > "${file}" \
    && printf 'export SCM_TOKEN="$(%s)"\n' "gp credential-helper get <<<host=\${scm_name}.com | sed -n 's/^password=//p'" >> "${file}"
```

- Follow [see in action](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/gitpod-yaml#see-it-in-action)

Now you can use `$SCM_TOKEN` environment variable after you commit and create a new workspace, this variable will contain an API token based on the Git context (i.e. Gitlab/GitHub/Bitbucket)

### How to use a private GitHub email or custom email for Git commits

At the [variables](https://gitpod.io/user/variables) page, create two variables[[1](https://gitpod.io/user/account)] called:

- GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
- GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL

and set the custom email address as the value and `*/*` as the scope.

Now all of your new workspaces should use them for Git commits. If you have a workspace running, you can restart it or run `eval "$(gp env -e)"` in it.

# Billing

Gitpod charges for usage based on how long workspaces run, and the resources consumed by different [workspace classes](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes). Metered usage also includes [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).

As an individual user, you receive a free usage allowance so that you can try Gitpod without a billing account. A personal billing account is required for additional usage beyond that.

Organization billing accounts provide a way to pay for organization members' usage when they run workspaces on organization projects.

## Credits

Gitpod usage is measured in **credits**.

Larger [workspace classes](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes) use credits at a faster rate. E.g. Standard workspaces use 10 credits per hour, whereas Large workspaces use 20 credits per hour.

Your invoice will show the total amount of credits consumed in a billing period.

## Configure personal billing

The personal billing page is located in your [account settings](https://gitpod.io/account).

> 💡 If you do not see "Billing" in your settings, cancel your existing plan or organization plan first.

The Gitpod Free plan comes with 500 free credits, renewed monthly. These credits can be used for all workspace classes. Unused credits expire at the end of each month.

Configuring a Personal billing plan in your user billing settings will increase your monthly credit allowance from 500 to 1000. Additional usage will be charged at the pay-as-you-go rate.

![Configure Personal billing](../../static/images/docs/billing/configure-personal-billing.png)

You can add a payment method with credit card details in Euros or Dollars.

![Add payment details](../../static/images/docs/billing/add-personal-payment-details.png)

Once billing has been configured, use the "Manage Plan" button to modify your payment details or cancel.

![Active Personal billing](../../static/images/docs/billing/active-personal-billing.png)

If you are a member of an organization with billing, you can select the organization to pay for all your personal usage under "Default Billing Account".

![Select default billing account](../../static/images/docs/billing/select-default-billing-account.png)

## Configure organization billing

Organization owners can configure billing for an organization in their organization settings.

> 💡 You may need to cancel your existing Professional or Unleashed organization-billing plan first.

![Configure Team Billing](../../static/images/docs/billing/configure-team-billing.png)

Once organization billing is configured, Gitpod will charge the organization billing account for usage by organization members, when they start workspaces on organization projects, and for prebuild usage on organization projects.

![Active Team billing](../../static/images/docs/billing/active-team-billing.png)

## Configure a usage limit

The usage limit prevents workspaces from starting once the limit has been reached. It will not stop running workspaces.

To change the usage limit, look for "Update limit" in the BALANCE section of your personal or organization billing settings, after you have configured billing.

![Active Team billing](../../static/images/docs/billing/update-usage-limit-2.png)

## View usage details

You can see the details of your personal usage when you click on "View Usage →" in your personal billing settings. Organization owners can view usage details for their organization.

![Active Team billing](../../static/images/docs/billing/view-team-usage-details.png)

## Old pricing plans

Users with old paid plans, may need to cancel those plans before configuring their personal or organization billing accounts.

- [Organization billing](/docs/configure/billing/org-billing)


## FAQs

### [How can I limit or optimize prebuild costs?](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1070648758716600371)
<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

There are a few built-in Gitpod features that can optimize your prebuild costs, such as:

- **Skip prebuilds** every X commits and use [last successful prebuild](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/projects/last-successful-prebuild)

- **Stop prebuilds** for all branches, PRs and etc. when on GitHub. See [this page](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml/#github). (might not be necessary)

### With prebuilds enabled, does every push to my repository cost me credits?

It depends on how you configured prebuilds. Prebuilds run on headless Gitpod workspaces and the cost depends on how long they run when triggered.

# Organization billing

> The plans below have been superseded by our [new billing model](/docs/configure/billing).

> This page is for users who are looking to manage or cancel their existing organization billing plans.

Organization billing allows you to pay for your whole organization with a single subscription. You can choose between the **Organization Professional** plan, or the **Organization Unleashed** plan.

With Organization billing, all plan seats will be managed automatically, by auto-subscribing new members, and unsubscribing members who leave.

Organization billing can be accessed under Organization Settings if you are an organization owner.

![Team billing New](../../../static/images/docs/team-billing-new.png)

Once a plan is active, Organization billing will auto-subscribe new members, and the count will update automatically.

Look for the green button to manage your payment details or to cancel your subscription.

![Team billing New](../../../static/images/docs/team-billing-subscribed.png)

## Good to know

- an organization can only have one active Organization billing plan.
- With Organization billing, all organization members, including owners, are auto-subscribed to the plan.
- New members are added using a shared [invite URL](/docs/configure/orgs#add-members-to-a-organization) which can be reset.
- When new members join in the middle of a billing period, you will be billed pro-rata for the remaining fraction of the month.
- See [Organizations & Projects](/docs/configure) to create a new Organization.

# Organization plans

> The organization plans below have been superseded by our [new billing model](/docs/configure/billing).

> This page is for users who are looking to manage or cancel their existing organization plans.

Organization plans allow you to pay for your whole organization with a single subscription.

Organization plans are accessed from [gitpod.io/orgs/](https://gitpod.io/orgs/) in your user settings.

You can choose between the **Organization Professional** plan, or the **Organization Unleashed** plan, and you can specify how many seats you want for each organization. Each member of the Organization Plan will then be able to use Gitpod as if they had purchased their own Professional or Unleashed plan.

![New Team Plan](../../../static/images/docs/team-plan-new.png)

Once the payment process is complete, you can manage organization members, add more organization seats, and also invite organization members using a unique public URL.

| Organization Plan Billing                                               | Manage Organization Plan Members                                                  |

| ![Team Plan Billing](../../../static/images/docs/team-plan-billing.png) | ![Manage Team Plan Members](../../../static/images/docs/team-plan-membership.png) |

You can either directly assign a seat by entering your organization member's GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket username, or use the `Invite Members` link from the more actions button to get a shareable link. Send the link to your organization so they can claim a seat.

| Manage an organization                                    | Invite Members                                            |

## Good to know

- You won't be assigned to a seat in your new organization plan when it is first created. Add yourself just like other members.
- If you add seats in the middle of a monthly billing period, you will be charged for the whole period.

# Configure Gitpod

You can open any repository in Gitpod by prefixing the full repository URL with `gitpod.io/#`.

**For example:** [https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nodejs/node](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nodejs/node)

> **Note:** For [Self-Hosted](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest), substitute gitpod.io for the domain of your installation.

To get the most out of Gitpod, commit a [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) to the root of your project to give instructions to Gitpod about what packages to install, which process to start, and much more.

## Workspaces

[Workspaces](/docs/configure/workspaces) are the developer environments where you code in Gitpod.

Workspaces can be created on their own, or as part of a [Project](/docs/configure/projects).

- [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image)
- [Tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks)
- [Ports](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports)
- [Collaboration](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration)
- [Multi-repo](/docs/configure/workspaces/multi-repo)
- [Workspace Classes](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes)

## User Settings

[User settings](/docs/configure/user-settings) allow you to customize your own personal Gitpod experience.

- [Browser Extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension)
- [Browser Settings](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-settings)
- [Browser Bookmarklet](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-bookmarklet)
- [Dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles)
- [SSH](/docs/configure/user-settings/ssh)
- [Access Tokens](/docs/configure/user-settings/access-tokens)

## Projects

[Projects](/docs/configure/projects) are the connection between Gitpod and one or more git repositories and allow you to manage [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds). Projects can be associated with your personal account, or associated with [Organizations](/docs/configure/orgs).

- [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds)
- [Incremental Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/incremental-prebuilds)
- [Last Successful Prebuild](/docs/configure/projects/last-successful-prebuild)
- [Environment Variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables)

## Organizations

[Organizations](/docs/configure/orgs) in Gitpod allow you to share projects and their settings amongst many organization individuals.

## Authentication

- [GitLab](/docs/configure/authentication/gitlab)
- [GitHub](/docs/configure/authentication/github)
- [BitBucket](/docs/configure/authentication/bitbucket)
- [GitHub Enterprise](/docs/configure/authentication/github-enterprise)

# Organizations

Organizations are used to share [Projects](/docs/configure/projects) amongst organization members.

There are two roles within a Gitpod organization **organization owners** and **organization members**. Organization members and owners can view branches and prebuilds for the projects within an organization. Organization members can open new workspaces directly from a branch in the dashboard. Organization owners can manage other organization members, reset user invite URLs, and manage [Organization billing](/docs/configure/billing/org-billing).

To collaborate with others on projects you can create a **Organization** and invite others as organization members.

### View organizations

To view all your organizations, click on the scope selector on the left of the top bar.

### Create an organization

To create a new organization:

1. On the top bar, click on the scope selector and select _New Organization_.
2. Next, you will be asked for an organization name that will serve also as the organization slug.

### Add members to an organization

Once you create an organization you can invite members by using the unique invite URL from the Members page within an organization.

### Change member permissions

New members will join with a _Member_ role which you can later change if needed from the Members list using the more actions button. See [Roles](#roles) below.

### Remove a member from an organization

You can remove an organization member form the Members list using the more actions button while hovering over the user entry.

### Filter members in an organization

On the Members page you can filter users by membership role using the filters above the Members list.

### Leaving an organization

You can leave an organization using the more actions button in the Members list while hovering over your user entry.

## Roles

| Permission                  | Owner | Member |

title: Environment Variables
---

<script context="module">
  export const prerender = true;
</script>

# Environment Variables

You can pass environment variables into your workspace and use them in your code as usual. Please refer to the documentation of your programming language of choice for details on that.

`youtube: dehln1E8ylY`

## Default Environment Variables

Below are some environment variables which are set automatically by Gitpod and are guaranteed to exist:

- `GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID`: The Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) associated with the workspace.
- `GITPOD_WORKSPACE_URL`: The unique URL of the workspace.
- `GITPOD_REPO_ROOT`: Path to the directory where your git repository was cloned inside the workspace.

> **Tip:** Try running **`env | grep GITPOD_`** on a workspace terminal to see all the Gitpod specific environment variables. These can be useful for scripting a dynamic workspace behavior.

#### Reserved Prefix

Environment variables beginning with the prefix `GITPOD_` are reserved for internal use by Gitpod and are overridden on every workspace startup. This means that a _user-defined_ variable set with the name `GITPOD_FOOBAR` will be ignored and not accessible in the workspace.

## User-Specific Environment Variables

Gitpod supports encrypted, user-specific environment variables.
They are stored as part of your user settings and can be used to set access tokens, or pass any other kind of user-specific information to your workspaces.

The `DOCKERD_ARGS` environment variable can be used to specify additional arguments to the docker installation running in your workspace. Currently
mapping a user in your container to the gitpod user in your workspace is supported. This helps if you are using an unprivileged user with your containers
(e.g. user 1000 in a node image) but need to edit files with vscode that have been created within the container. The content of the environment variable
should look like this:

```json
{ "remap-user": "1000" }
```

### Ways of setting user-specific environment variables

#### Using the command line: `gp env`

The `gp` CLI prints and modifies the persistent environment variables associated with your user for the current repository.

To set the persistent environment variable `foo` to the value `bar` use:

```sh
gp env foo=bar
```

Beware that this does not modify your current terminal session, but rather persists this variable for the next workspace on this repository.
`gp` can only interact with the persistent environment variables for this repository, not the environment variables of your terminal.
If you want to set that environment variable in your terminal, you can do so using -e:

```sh
eval $(gp env -e foo=bar)
```

If you're using `fish` shell:

```sh
eval (gp env -e foo=bar)
```

To update the current terminal session with the latest set of persistent environment variables, use:

```sh
eval $(gp env -e)
```

If you're using `fish` shell:

```sh
eval (gp env -e)
```

To delete a persistent environment variable use:

```sh
gp env -u foo

# And if you want to remove it from your shell session too:
unset foo
```

Note that you can delete/unset variables if their repository pattern matches the repository of this workspace exactly. I.e. you cannot
delete environment variables with a repository pattern of _/foo, foo/_ or _/_.

```sh
Usage:
  gp env [flags]

Flags:
  -e, --export   produce a script that can be eval'ed in Bash
  -h, --help     help for env
  -u, --unset    deletes/unsets persisted environment variables
```

#### Using the account settings

You can also configure and view the persistent environment variables in [your account settings](https://gitpod.io/variables).

![Environment Variables in Account Settings](../../../static/images/docs/beta/configure/environment-variables/environment-variables-account-settings.png)

You can add as many environment variables as you wish.

The repository pattern of each variable determines in what workspace it will be available.
Repository patterns follow the `owner/repository` pattern. You can use a wildcard on either of the two, e.g. `gitpod-io/*` would make that variable available in all repositories owned by `gitpod-io`.
Conversely `*/vscode` would make that variable available on all repositories called `vscode`; this is especially useful for forks.
Subsequently `*/*` makes that variable available in every workspace.

> **Beware:** while the variable values are stored encrypted, they are available as plain text inside a workspace. Be careful when sharing your live workspace or when using `*/*` as repository pattern.

## Project-Specific Environment Variables

Environment variables which are defined in [project](/docs/configure/projects) settings will be visible in prebuilds, and optionally also in workspaces. This is useful for prebuilds to access restricted services.

Important notes:

- Project-Specific Environment Variables will take precedence over [User-Specific Environment Variables](#user-specific-environment-variables)
- The `gp env` command is only linked with [User-Specific Environment Variables](#user-specific-environment-variables) but not Project-Specific Environment Variables. That means, if you set an environment variable with the `gp env` command, it will be saved in [your account settings](https://gitpod.io/variables).

> **Warning:** Care should be taken with secrets. Allowing secrets to be accessed from workspaces will expose those secrets to anyone who can open the workspace.

## Task terminal-specific Environment Variables

You can set environment variables for a Gitpod `task` terminal by setting the `env` property within the task definition in your `.gitpod.yml`. Please note that such environment variables will be limited to the `task` terminal and are not globally set across the workspace.

### Using the `env` keyword

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Example of setting an environment variable for a task terminal
    env:
      PRINT_ME: "Hello World!"
    command: echo "$PRINT_ME"
```

Note: The values should be a static string or integer, you can't refer to an existing variable via `env` keyword.

### Using the task SHELL

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Example of starting yarn with a custom environment variable set
    command: |
      # Example for referring to the existing system variables
      export API_URL="$HOSTNAME"

      # Print out the environment variable
      echo "$API_URL"

      yarn start

  - name: Example of updating PATH environment variable inside a task shell
    command: |
      # Download and install `fzf` binary to ~/.local/bin/
      mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
      curl -sL "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/download/0.35.1/fzf-0.35.1-linux_amd64.tar.gz" | tar -C ~/.local/bin -xpz

      # Update PATH variable
      export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

      # Now `fzf` can be called without full path from the task shell
      ls / | fzf
```

Note: You can use this method when you need to refer to other variables or want to use scripting to set them conditionally.

See [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml#tasksnenv) for more details.

## Providing one-time environment variables via URL

> ❗️ This feature is great for setting one-time environment variables for dynamic workspace configurations or setups but is not appropriate for configuring sensitive information, such as passwords or long-lived API tokens. Gitpod and the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url) recommends that you do not pass sensitive information through query strings. Refer to [CWE-598](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html) to learn more about this recommendation.

In addition to user-specific environment variables, Gitpod also allows passing in variables through the `gitpod.io/#` URL.
The syntax for that is:

```
https://gitpod.io/#var=value,var2=value2/https://github.com/my-org/repo-to-work-on
```

The values are [URL encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp) to allow any non-ascii characters in values.
In case of a conflict, e.g. in the example above if the user already had a variable `var2` set, the user's value would be used.

## Exporting all the Gitpod environment variables that you created

You can run the following command in your Gitpod Workspace terminal to save your environment variables (which you have configured in [Gitpod Environment Variables](https://gitpod.io/variables)) in a different file (e.g.: gitpod.env):

```bash
gp env > gitpod.env
```

title: Incremental Prebuilds

# Incremental Prebuilds

Similar to [last successful prebuild](/docs/configure/projects/last-successful-prebuild), incremental prebuilds leverage older prebuilds in order to create new prebuilds faster.

![Enable Incremental Prebuilds](../../../static/images/docs/projects/enable-incremental-prebuilds.webp)

An incremental prebuild is based on an older prebuild that was built for an older commit, in order to reuse pre-existing build artifacts. This is achieved by:

1. Loading the older prebuild
2. Updating the source code to the latest commit
3. Running any `before`, `prebuild`, and `init` tasks again (incremental rebuild)<br>_Note: This means that your init tasks will be run twice on the same checkout, i.e. they need to be reentrant_

## How is a base prebuild selected?

When incremental prebuilds are enabled for a project, and a new prebuild is being triggered, Gitpod will do the following:

1. Retrieve the commit history of the current commit to be built (up to 100 ancestor commits)
2. For each ancestor commit, check if there exists a corresponding prebuild that can be used as a "base":
   - A suitable "base prebuild" must have been successful (i.e. failed, canceled, or timed out prebuilds are not reused)
   - It must be a recent, direct ancestor of the current commit (i.e. not a commit from a different unrelated branch)
   - It must be based on the same project configuration as the current commit (for example, if the Docker image or the `init` tasks have recently been changed, older prebuilds are no longer relevant or useful and cannot be used as a "base")
3. If a suitable base prebuild is found, Gitpod will load it; update the checkout to the latest commit; and then re-run any `before`, `prebuild` and `init` task on top of it
   - If no suitable base prebuild is found, Gitpod will build the new prebuild from scratch (i.e. a non-incremental prebuild)

## When are incremental prebuilds useful?

Incremental prebuilds can significantly speed up most of your prebuilds, especially if:

```
(time_to_load_older_prebuild + incremental_rebuild_duration) < full_prebuild_duration
```

Typically, enabling incremental prebuilds makes sense if:

- Your project's build system benefits from incremental rebuilds (i.e. rebuilds are significantly faster than your initial build)
- Your regular prebuilds take longer than 5 minutes (the longer they take, the bigger the potential speedup is)

# Projects

Projects live under a Gitpod organization. They connect Gitpod to a git repository. A Gitpod project can only have one git repository, and a git repository can only belong to one project.

A project is required in order to trigger [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) on a repository. Organization members use the project to configure and view prebuilds.

With [organization billing](/docs/configure/billing#configure-organization-billing), all project usage such as workspaces and prebuilds, may be billed to the organization.

Projects have a static URL based on the organization and project name, for example:

<!-- TODO: Update slug, depends upon => https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/16050#pullrequestreview-1272075181 -->

`https://gitpod.io/t/<team>/<project>`

### View projects

The Projects page for a organization shows a card for each project.

Cards show the name, repository URL, quick links to project branches and prebuilds, and the branch and timestamp of the latest prebuild.

### Add a new project

To add a new project, click on _New Project_ on the Projects page for the organization, and select a repository from the list.

The list will show repositories from one of your git providers. Select a different provider if necessary. You may also be prompted to configure our [GitHub app](/docs/configure/authentication/github#authorizing-github-webhooks), the first time a project is created for a GitHub account. The new project will be associated with the current organization selected in the dashboard.

### Configure a project

Organization members can configure Prebuilds, and set the workspace class used for project workspaces, in project settings.

![Project Settings](../../../static/images/docs/project-settings.png)

### Remove a project

You can remove a project using the "Remove project" action from a project card.

# Last Successful Prebuild

> {title} is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/15310).

Similar to [incremental prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/incremental-prebuilds), last successful prebuild leverages older prebuilds in order to create new workspaces faster.

![Use Last Successful Prebuild](../../../static/images/docs/projects/use-last-successful-prebuild.webp)

When enabled, new workspaces may start based on a prebuild that was built for an older commit, in order to reuse any existing build artifacts. This is achieved by:

1. Loading the older prebuild
2. Updating the source code to the latest commit
3. Running any `before`, `prebuild`, and `init` tasks again interactively (incremental rebuild)<br>_Note: This means that your init tasks will be run twice on the same checkout, i.e. they need to be reentrant_

Thus, your new workspace will both:

- _load quickly_: no waiting, even if a newer prebuild is still being computed (i.e. you'll never see the "Prebuild in Progress" screen again ⏩)
- and it will be _ready quickly_: your IDE Terminal will run either no build at all (if none is needed), or just a quick incremental rebuild (faster than a full build ♻️)

## Skip Prebuilds

When Gitpod can leverage older prebuilds to start your workspaces faster, you no longer necessarily need to create a new prebuild for every commit that is pushed to your repository.

This is where the ability to skip prebuilds becomes helpful: For example, you could decide to only trigger a new prebuild every 5 commits, or every 10 commits.

The ideal number depends on your project. For example:

- If you push new commits to your repository very frequently, you may want a higher number (especially if your prebuilds also take a long time to build)
- On the other hand, if your prebuilds finish quickly, and you typically don't push new commits very often, it may be fine to not skip any prebuild (i.e. `skip prebuilds = 0`)

Please feel free to adjust and experiment with this value.

# Prebuilds

Prebuilds reduce wait time, by installing dependencies or running builds **before** you start a new workspace.

`youtube: DwkoOz1GSVg`

## .gitpod.yml

Prebuilds are typically configured using an `init` [task](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) in your gitpod.yml.

In the example below, the `init` task installs npm packages into the node_modules directory of the workspace. The `command` task runs 'npm start' on every workspace startup.

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: |
      npm install
  - command: |
      npm start
```

## Enable prebuilds on your repository project

Use the following steps to enable prebuilds on your repository:

- [Create a project](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds#projects-and-prebuilds) for the repository.
- Define the prebuild steps in an init [task](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) in your [gitpod.yml](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml).

Since prebuilds are included in all our metered [pay-as-you-go](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/billing) plans, configuring prebuild settings in your project should help with managing prebuild usage.

## Projects and prebuilds

For prebuilds to run automatically, you also need a [project](/docs/configure#projects) for your repository.

To create a new project:

- Click on _New Project_ in the Projects page of one your organizations.
<figure>
<video onloadstart="this.playbackRate = 1.5;" controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="ARepl extension example" src="/images/docs/projects/prebuilds.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>Create a new project in one of your organizations to enable prebuilds</figcaption>
</figure>

- If necessary, you will be prompted for additional authorization to install and configure the Gitpod GitHub app,
  so that Gitpod can watch your repositories and trigger prebuilds.
- Select the repository for your project.

### View prebuilds

You can find a list of recent prebuilds under the **Prebuilds** tab for your project.

![Recent prebuilds list for an example project](/images/docs/projects/prebuild-dashboard.webp)

From here, you may also trigger a new prebuild based on the last commit in the project. Selecting a prebuild will open the details page showing the current status as well as additional logs. From the prebuild details page, you may rerun the selected prebuild or start a new workspace based on it.

### Rerun a prebuild

Prebuilds can be triggered again which can be particularly useful when debugging an unexpected failure.

To rerun a prebuild:

1. Navigate to your project and select the **Prebuilds** tab.
2. Select the prebuild you wish to rerun.
3. Select **Rerun Prebuild**.

### Start workspace based on existing prebuild

To start a workspace using an existing prebuild:

1. Navigate to your project and select the **Prebuilds** tab.
2. Select the prebuild you wish to start a workspace on top of.
3. Select **New Workspace (with this prebuild)**.

## Prebuilds are shared

Gitpod can trigger a prebuild whenever there is a commit to a repository. That prebuild will then be used for all new workspaces opened on that branch. This is ideal for working together on branches for testing or code reviews.

Prebuild users will see a message in their workspace terminal like this:

```txt
🤙 This task ran as a workspace prebuild
```

## Workspace directory only

Prebuilds save **only** the workspace directory. Other directories like the home directory are not saved by prebuilds.

To use global installs like 'npm install -g', we suggest using a custom Dockerfile or a `before` task, which runs before the init task, and runs again before the command task.

#### Project environment variables

Environment variables which are defined in project settings will be visible in prebuilds. This is useful for prebuilds to access restricted services.

**WARNING**
Care should be taken with secrets in prebuilds. Do not save secrets in a way which could leak into workspaces. This especially true for public repositories.

## Configuring prebuilds manually

All prebuilds require a [Gitpod project](/docs/configure/projects#add-a-new-project) for the repository.

For a GitLab or Bitbucket repository, allow Gitpod to install repository webhooks, by granting `api` permissions in your [git provider integrations](https://gitpod.io/integrations)

For GitLab, if you want to trigger new Gitpod prebuilds for specific branches only, you can configure this in your GitLab [project settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#branch-filtering).

By default, Gitpod prepares prebuilt workspaces for all changes on the default branch and for pull/merge requests coming from the same repository.

> **Note**: Prebuilds are executed as the user who enabled them. This means that if you want to use
> prebuilds on a private repository, you must give Gitpod access to private repositories.

Prebuilds are configured in your repository's [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file with the following start tasks:

- `before`
- `init`

Note the absence of the `command` task. Since this task may potentially run indefinitely, e.g. if you start a dev server, Gitpod does not execute the `command` task during prebuilds.

Prebuilds have a timeout of 1 hour. If your `before` and `init` tasks combined exceed 1 hour, your prebuild will fail. Subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6283) for updates when this limit will be lifted.

Each prebuild starts with a clean environment. In other words, Gitpod does not cache artifacts between prebuilds.

Incremental Prebuilds use an earlier, successful Prebuild as the base. This can reduce the duration of your Prebuilds significantly, especially if they normally take more than ten minutes to complete. Incremental Prebuilds can be found under the project settings in your Gitpod dashboard.

## GitHub-specific configuration

The `github` `prebuilds` section in the `.gitpod.yml` file configures when prebuilds are run.
By default, prebuilds are run on push to the default branch and for each pull request coming from the same repository.
Additionally, you can enable prebuilds for all branches (`branches`) and for pull requests from forks (`pullRequestsFromForks`).

> **Note:** The Gitpod GitHub app has no equivalent for GitLab or Bitbucket yet, so this entire section is GitHub-specific for now.

```yaml
github:
  prebuilds:
    # enable for the default branch (defaults to true)
    master: true
    # enable for all branches in this repo (defaults to false)
    branches: false
    # enable for pull requests coming from this repo (defaults to true)
    pullRequests: true
    # enable for pull requests coming from forks (defaults to false)
    pullRequestsFromForks: false
    # add a check to pull requests (defaults to true)
    addCheck: true
    # add a "Review in Gitpod" button as a comment to pull requests (defaults to false)
    addComment: false
    # add a "Review in Gitpod" button to the pull request's description (defaults to false)
    addBadge: false
```

#### Additional GitHub integration

Once the GitHub app is installed, Gitpod can add helpful annotations to your pull requests.

#### Checks

By default, Gitpod registers itself as a check to pull requests - much like a continuous integration system would do.

The default behavior, however, would not make the checks fail when the prebuild failed.
This can be enabled with the following snippet:

```yaml
github:
  prebuilds:
    addCheck: prevent-merge-on-error
```

You can disable this behaviour in the `.gitpod.yml` file in your default branch:

```yaml
github:
  prebuilds:
    addCheck: false
```

#### Comment

Gitpod can add a comment with an "Open in Gitpod" button to your pull requests.

You can enable this behaviour in the `.gitpod.yml` file in your default branch:

```yaml
github:
  prebuilds:
    addComment: true
```

#### Badge

Instead of adding a comment, Gitpod can also modify the description of a pull request to add the "Open in Gitpod" button.
This approach produces fewer GitHub notifications, but can also create a concurrent editing conflict when the bot and a user try to edit the description of a pull request at the same time.

You can enable this behaviour in the `.gitpod.yml` file in your default branch:

```yaml
github:
  prebuilds:
    addBadge: true
```

The `addComment` and `addBadge` behaviours are not mutually exclusive (i.e. enabling one does not disable the other).
If you don't want the comments to be added, disable them using `addComment: false`.

## User specific environment variables in prebuilds

It is not necessarily best practice to have user specific environment variables in a prebuild `init` block, but sometimes there are build time requirements that mean certain tokens need setting or files need creating. Environment variables defined within your Gitpod Variables preferences are not imported by default, but they can be accessed with the following command within a `before` or `init` block:

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: |
      eval $(command gp env -e)
      echo "Hello ${MY_VAR}"
```

After that, the available environment variables will be installed into the rest of you shell script and can be accessed normally.

Gitpod does not implement user authentication itself, but integrates with other auth provider using [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).
Usually your Git hosting solution (e.g. GitHub or GitLab) acts as the OAuth auth provider. This way we control access to Gitpod while at
the same time making sure every user has proper access to their Git repository.

Gitpod supports the following authentication providers:

- github.com
- GitHub Enterprise in version 2.16.x and higher
- gitlab.com
- GitLab Community Edition in version 11.7.x and higher
- GitLab Enterprise Edition in version 11.7.x and higher
- Bitbucket — coming soon
- Custom Auth Provider – Inquiry TypeFox for a quote

## GitHub

To authenticate your users with GitHub you need to create a [GitHub OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).
Follow the guide linked above and:

- set "Authentication callback URL" to after replacing example.com with your domain name:

  https://example.com/auth/github/callback

- copy the following values and configure them in `values.yaml`:
  - `clientId`
  - `clientSecret`

## GitLab

To authenticate your users with GitLab you need to create an [GitLab OAuth application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html).
Follow the guide linked above and:

- set "Authentication callback URL" to:

  https://<your-domain.com>/auth/<gitlab.com-OR-your-gitlab.com>/callback

- set "Scopes" to `api`, `read_user` and `read_repository`.
- copy the following values and configure them in `values.yaml`:
  - `clientId` is the "Application ID" from the GitLab OAuth application
  - `clientSecret` is the "Secret" from the GitLab OAuth application

# Configure the database used by your Gitpod installation

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../../latest) instead.

Gitpod uses a MySQL database to store user data. By default Gitpod ships with a MySQL database built-in. If you operate your own MySQL database (which we'd recommend in a production setting) you can use that one. You have the following options:

- Integrated database: If not disabled, this MySQL database is installed in a Kubernetes pod as a part of Gitpod’s Helm chart.
  The database uses a Kubernetes PersistentVolume. We do not recommend using this option for a production setting.

- Own MySQL database: Gitpod requires MySQL in version 5.7 or newer.

This chart installs a MySQL database that gets Gitpod up and running but is not suitable for production (the data is lost on each restart of the DB pod). To connect to a proper MySQL installation:

1.  Copy the DB init scripts into your local folder:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p gpinstall
    echo exit | docker run -v $PWD/gpinstall:/workspace -u $(id -u) -i gcr.io/gitpod-io/self-hosted/installer:latest bash
    mkdir -p ./db-init
    cp gpinstall/gitpod/helm/gitpod/config/db/init/*.sql ./db-init/
    rm -Rf gpinstall
    ```
1.  Initialize your MySQL database using the SQL files in `config/db/init/`. E.g. in a mysql session connected to your database server run:
    ```sql
    SET @gitpodDbPassword = IFNULL(@gitpodDbPassword, 'your-password-goes-here');
    source db-init/00-testdb-user.sql;
    source db-init/01-create-user.sql;
    source db-init/02-create-and-init-sessions-db.sql;
    source db-init/03-recreate-gitpod-db.sql;
    ```
1.  Merge the following into your `values.custom.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    db:
      host: db
      port: 3306
      password: your-password-goes-here

    # Disable built-in MySQL instance
    mysql:
      enabled: false
    ```

1.  Do a `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes.

# Configure the Docker registry used by your Gitpod Self-Hosted installation

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../../latest) instead.

Gitpod builds Docker images during workspace startup. This enables custom Dockerfiles as part of your workspace config, but is also required for Gitpod itself to function.
To this end, Gitpod requires a container registry where it can push the images it builds.

By default Gitpod ships with a built-in Docker registry. If you operate your own Docker registry (which we'd recommend in a production setting) you can use that one. You have the following options:

- Integrated Docker registry: If not disabled, this Docker registry is installed in a Kubernetes Pod as a dependency of Gitpod’s Helm chart.
  The Docker registry requires a Kubernetes PersistentVolume. This registry is not recommended to be used for production.
- Own Docker registry: Gitpod can connect to your own Docker registry. Compared to its built-in counterpart this enables performance gains and access to otherwise private images.

This helm chart can either deploy its own registry (default but requires [HTTPS certs](./ingress)) or use an existing one.

## Configuration

To connect to an existing Docker registry, perform the following steps:

1.  Merge the following into your `values.custom.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    components:
      imageBuilder:
        registryCerts: []
        registry:
          # name must not end with a "/"
          name: your.registry.com/gitpod
          secretName: image-builder-registry-secret
          path: secrets/registry-auth.json

      workspace:
        pullSecret:
          secretName: image-builder-registry-secret

    docker-registry:
      enabled: false
    ```

    Replace `your.registry.com/gitpod` with the domain your registry is available at.

    > Note that Helm does _not_ merge hierarchies in a single file. Please make sure there is only ever _one_ `components` hierarchy or the last one overwrites all previous values.

2.  Persist your registry authentication token to the `secrets/` folder.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p secrets
    docker login your.registry.com/gitpod
    cp ~/.docker/config.json secrets/registry-auth.json
    ```

    > This does not work for Google Cloud Registries because their login tokens are short-lived. See the [example](#example-google-cloud-registry-credentials) below on how to configure it.

3.  Do a `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes.

Make sure the resulting JSON file contains the credentials (there should be an `auths` section containing them as base64 encoded string).

If that's not the case you might have a credential store/helper set up (e.g. on macOS the _Securely store Docker logins in macOS keychain_ setting).

### Example Google Cloud Registry Credentials

Prerequisites:

- `gcloud` [installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) and [authenticated](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login)

How to use Google Cloud Registry as Docker registry for Gitpod:

1.  Go to <a class="no-nowrap" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/%3Cyour-project-id%3E?project=%3Cyour-project-id%3E">https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/\<your-project-id>?project=\<your-project-id></your-project-id></your-project-id></a> and hit "Enable Registry API" (if not already enabled).

1.  Execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    export PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>"

    gcloud iam service-accounts create gitpod-registry-full --project=$PROJECT_ID
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member="serviceAccount:gitpod-registry-full@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role=roles/storage.admin
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create gitpod-registry-full-key.json --iam-account=gitpod-registry-full@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

    echo "{\"auths\":{\"gcr.io\": {\"auth\": \"$(echo -n "$(echo -n "_json_key:"; cat gitpod-registry-full-key.json)" | base64 -w 0)\"}}}" > secrets/registry-auth.json
    ```

    This should result in a `secrets/registry-auth.json` like this:

    ```json
    {
      "auths": {
        "gcr.io": {
          "auth": "<long-base64-string>"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    > If you want to use the localized versions of gcr.io (eu.gcr.io, for instance) make sure to update the json file accordingly.

# Configure the ingress to your Gitpod installation

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../../latest) instead.

Configuring ingress into your Gitpod installation requires two things:

- three DNS entries pointing at the IP of Gitpod's proxy service, and
- HTTPS certificates.

## 1. DNS Entries

Gitpod requires a domain resolvable by some nameserver (typically a public domain name, e.g. `your-domain.com`).
As Gitpod launches services and workspaces on additional subdomains it also needs two wildcard domains.
For example:

    your-domain.com
    *.your-domain.com
    *.ws.your-domain.com

Installing Gitpod on a subdomain works as well. For example:

    gitpod.your-domain.com
    *.gitpod.your-domain.com
    *.ws.gitpod.your-domain.com

1.  Setup `A` records for all three (sub)domains. To learn your installation's IP run:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe svc proxy | grep -i ingress
    ```

1.  Merge the following into your `values.custom.yaml` file:
    ```yaml
    hostname: your-domain.com
    components:
      proxy:
        loadBalancerIP: <your-IP>
    ```
    Specifying the `loadBalancerIP` make sure it stays the same across all redeploys.

## 2. HTTPS

Gitpod requires HTTPS certificates to function properly. We recommend using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for retrieving certificates as we do for [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io).

> Important: The HTTPS certificates for your domain must include `your-domain.com`, `*.your-domain.com` and `*.ws.your-domain.com`. Beware that wildcard certificates are valid for one level only (i.e. `*.a.com` is not valid for `c.b.a.com`).

To configure the HTTPS certificates for your domain

1.  [Generate certificates](#using-lets-encrypt-to-generate-https-certificates) and put your certificate files under `secrets/https-certificates/`:
    ```text
    secrets/https-certificates:
      |- tls.crt
      |- tls.key
    ```
2.  Generate the [dhparams.pem](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/94390/whats-the-purpose-of-dh-parameters) file using:
    ```bash
    openssl dhparam -out secrets/https-certificates/dhparams.pem 2048
    ```
3.  Create a kubernetes secret using:
    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic https-certificates --from-file=secrets/https-certificates
    ```
4.  Afterwards, do an `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes.

### Using Let's Encrypt to generate HTTPS certificates

The most accessible means of obtaining HTTPS certificates is using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). It provides free certificates to anybody who can prove ownership of a domain.
Let's Encrypt offers a program called [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to make acquiring certificates as straightforward as possible.

Assuming you have [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) installed, the following script will generate and configure the required certificates (notice the placeholders):

```bash
export DOMAIN=your-domain.com
export EMAIL=your@email.here
export WORKDIR=$PWD/letsencrypt

certbot certonly \
    --config-dir $WORKDIR/config \
    --work-dir $WORKDIR/work \
    --logs-dir $WORKDIR/logs \
    --manual \
    --preferred-challenges=dns \
    --email $EMAIL \
    --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
    --agree-tos \
    -d *.ws.$DOMAIN \
    -d *.$DOMAIN \
    -d $DOMAIN

# move them into place
mkdir -p secrets/https-certificates
cp $WORKDIR/config/live/fullchain.pem secrets/https-certificates/tls.crt
cp $WORKDIR/config/live/privkey.pem secrets/https-certificates/tls.key
```

> Note: Do not refrain if `certbot` fails on first execution: Depending on the challenge used you might have to restart it _once_.

# Configure the Kubernetes nodes in your Gitpod Self-Hosted installation

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../../latest) instead.

Configure the nodes (computers or virtual machines) that Kubernetes runs Gitpod's workspace pods on.

## Assign workload to Nodes

Gitpod schedules two kinds of workloads: the Gitpod installation itself (which we refer to as _meta_) and the workspaces. Ideally both types of workloads run on separate nodes to make makes scaling easier.
Depending on your cluster size that may not be feasible though. Either way, you need two node labels in your cluster:

- `gitpod.io/workload_meta=true` which marks the "meta" nodes and
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace=true ` which marks the workspace nodes.

If you want to "mix 'n match", i.e., don't separate the nodes, you can simply run:

```bash
kubectl label node --all gitpod.io/workload_meta=true gitpod.io/workload_workspace=true
```

## Node Filesystem Layout

Gitpod relies on the node's filesystem for making workspace content available, as well as for storing Theia. By default workspace data is placed in `/data` and Theia is copied to `/theia`. Depending on your node setup the root filesystem maybe **read-only** or **slow**.
We recommend you change those two paths so that they're located on an SSD or some other form of fast local storage.

To do this:

1.  Merge the following into your `values.custom.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    components:
      imageBuilder:
        # The image builder deploys a Docker-in-Docker-daemon. By default that Docker daemon works in an empty-dir on the node.
        # Depending on the types of node you operate that may cause image builds to fail or not perform well. We recommend you give the Docker daemon
        # fast storage on the node, e.g. an SSD.
        hostDindData: /mnt/disks/ssd0/docker
      wsDaemon:
        # Workspace data is stored on the nodes. This setting configures where on the node the workspace data lives.
        # The faster this location is (in terms of IO) the faster workspaces will initialize.
        hostWorkspaceArea: /mnt/disks/ssd0/workspaces
    ```
2.  Do a `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes.

    > Note that Helm does _not_ merge hierarchies in a single file. Please make sure there is only ever _one_ `components` hierarchy or the last one overwrites all previous values.

# Configure the storage used by your Gitpod installation

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../../latest) instead.

Gitpod uses bucket storage to persist the contents of workspaces. Each workspace is tarballed into a single archive file which is then uploaded to a separate bucket.

By default Gitpod installs [MinIO](https://min.io/) as built-in bucket storage which uses a [persistent volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) to store workspace content.

For more complex use case we recommend configuring more permanent means of persistence by either:

- Configure the contained MinIO-instance to serve as a [gateway](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/gateway) OR configure one of a [wide range of storage backends](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes).
- Bring your own storage bucket: Configure Gitpod to either connect to:
  - your own installation of MinIO
  - a Google Cloud Storage compatible storage solution

## a) Configure custom MinIO instance

1.  Create a file `values.custom.yaml` with this content:

    ```yaml
    components:
      contentService:
        remoteStorage:
          kind: minio
          minio:
            endpoint: your-minio-installation.somewhere-else.com:8080
            accessKey: enterKeyHere
            secretKey: superSecretKeyGoesHere
            tmpdir: /tmp

    # Disable built-in minio instance
    minio:
      enabled: false
    ```

2.  Redeploy Gitpod using `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes

    > Note that Helm does _not_ merge hierarchies in a single file. Please make sure there is only ever _one_ `components` hierarchy or the last one overwrites all previous values.

## b) Configure the built-in MinIO instance

1.  Consult the chart's documentation at https://helm.min.io/
2.  Create a file `values.custom.yaml` with this content:
    ```yaml
    minio:
      accessKey: add-a-radom-access-key-here
      secretKey: add-a-radom-secret-key-here
      # insert custom config here
    ```
3.  Redeploy Gitpod using `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes

Gitpod uses the public [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org) registry as only products produced by Microsoft may access the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. This document explains how Gitpod Self-Hosted can be configured in air-gapped scenarios to connect to a private OpenVSX registry.

## Configuration

To connect to private OpenVSX registry, perform the following steps:

1.  Merge the following into your `values.custom.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    components:
      openVsxProxy:
        vsxRegistryUrl: open-vsx.org
    ```

    Replace `open-vsx.org` with the domain your registry is available at.

2.  Do a `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes.

## Sizing

Gitpod schedules workspaces as Kubernetes pods. Each workspace pod requests a certain amount of memory which directly affects how many workspaces are scheduled on a single node.
If you want to change the default sizing (~ 8GiB per workspace) you should

1.  Merge the following into your `values.custom.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    # workspaceSizing configures the resources available to each workspace. These settings directly impact how
    # desenly we pack workspaces on nodes where workspacesPerNode = memoryAvailable(node) / memoryRequest.
    #
    # Beware: if a workspace exceeds its memoryLimit, some of its processes may be terminated (OOM-kill) which
    # results in a broken user experience.
    workspaceSizing:
      requests:
        cpu: "1m"
        memory: "2.25Gi"
        storage: "5Gi"
      limits:
        cpu: "5"
        memory: "12Gi"
      dynamic:
        # Gitpod supports dynamic CPU limiting. We express those limits in "buckets of CPU time" (jiffies where 1 jiffie is 1% of a vCPU).
        # Each bucket has a limit (i.e. max CPU rate in jiffies/sec, 100 jiffies/sec = 1 vCPU).
        #
        # For example:
        #   # three minutes of 5 CPUs: 5 [numCPU] * 100 [jiffies/sec] * (3 * 60) [seconds] = 90000
        #   - budget: 90000
        #     limit: 500
        #   # five minutes  of 4 CPUs: 4 [numCPU] * 100 [jiffies/sec] * (5 * 60) [seconds] = 120000
        #   - budget: 120000
        #     limit: 400
        #   # remainder of 2 CPUs where a user has to stay below sustained use of 1.8 CPUs for 5 minutes:
        #   #                       1.8 [numCPU] * 100 [jiffies/sec] * (5 * 60) [seconds] = 54000
        #   - budget: 54000
        #     limit: 200
        #
        # if there are no buckets configured, the dynamic CPU limiting is disabled.
        cpu:
          buckets: []
          samplingPeriod: "10s"
          controlPeriod: "15m"
    ```

2.  Do a `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes.

# Install Gitpod Self-Hosted on Kubernetes

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../../latest) instead.

This section describes how to install Gitpod on any Kubernetes cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh). This is the most flexible and generic way of installing Gitpod. The chart for stable releases resides in Helm repository [charts.gitpod.io](https://charts.gitpod.io), charts for branch-builds can be found [here](#install-branch-build), and the source of the charts is in our [public git repository](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/chart/).

For some platforms we offer [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) scripts that ease the infrastructure setup. Once the script has created the necessary infrastructure it will output a `values.terraform.yaml` that contains infrastructure-specific configuration for the `helm` deployment.

## Prerequisites

See [Installation requirements for Gitpod Self-Hosted](../requirements).

## Installation

To install Gitpod in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. Create a file `values.custom.yaml` with the following content (please replace the keys/secrets, for instance with `openssl rand -hex 20`):

   ```yaml
   docker-registry:
     authentication:
       username: gitpod
       password: your-registry-password
   rabbitmq:
     auth:
       username: your-rabbitmq-user
       password: your-secret-rabbitmq-password
   minio:
     accessKey: your-random-access-key
     secretKey: your-random-secret-key
   ```

   You should replace the keys with 2 different random strings unique for your installation.

1. Run the following commands in your local terminal:

   ```bash
   helm repo add gitpod.io https://charts.gitpod.io

   helm repo update

   helm install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0
   ```

1. Configure [domain and https](../configuration/ingress).

1. Run `kubectl get pods` and verify that all pods are in state `RUNNING`. If some are not, please see the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting).

1. Go to `https://<your-domain.com>` and follow the steps to complete the installation.

## Upgrade

1.  Check the [Upgrade Guide](../updating) and follow the steps outlined there.

1.  Run the update

    ```bash
    helm install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0
    ```

1.  Run `kubectl get pods` and verify that all pods are in state `RUNNING`. If some are not, please see the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting).

## Recommended Configuration

By default, the Helm chart installs a working Gitpod installation in a lot of scenarios. Yet, there are certain things you might want to review when installing Gitpod for long term use and/or a bigger audience:

- [**Database**](../configuration/database): Configure where Gitpod stores all internal runtime data.
- [**Storage**](../configuration/storage): Configure where Gitpod persists workspace content.
- [**Docker Registry**](../configuration/docker-registry): Configure where Gitpod stores workspace images.

## Customization

Further customizations:

- [**Kubernetes Nodes**](../configuration/nodes): Configure file system layout and the workspace's node associativity.
- [**Workspaces**](../configuration/workspaces): Configure workspace sizing.

# Installation requirements for Gitpod Self-Hosted

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../latest) instead.

This page details the software and hardware requirements for installing Gitpod Self-Hosted on your own infrastructure.

## Supported Kubernetes distributions

Gitpod Self-Hosted runs well on:

- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
- Google Kubernetes Engine
- K3s
- Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service

## Incompatible Kubernetes distributions

These platforms do not currently work with Gitpod Self-Hosted but we would like to support them in the future. Gitpod is an open-source project, maybe you could contribute the required changes to help get them working sooner?

- [Red Hat® OpenShift®](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5409)
- [Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5410)

If you are considering purchasing a commercial license for Gitpod Self-Hosted and need one of the above platforms then please [contact us](/contact/sales) to start discussions about making support for them happen sooner.

## Minimum Kubernetes requirements

We strongly recommend deploying a dedicated kubernetes cluster just for Gitpod Self-Hosted.

Here are the minimum requirements:

- Either Ubuntu 18.04 with ≥ v5.4 kernel or Ubuntu 20.04 with ≥ v5.4 kernel.
- Calico for the networking overlay and network policy.
- Kubernetes ≥ 1.18.
- containerd ≥ 1.2.
- helm ≥ 3.6.

## Minimum compute resources

If you want to run Gitpod Self-Hosted at home we recommend at minimum 2vCPU's and 8GB of memory. For a better experience we recommend at least 4vCPUs and 16GB RAM for workspace nodes. For cost efficiency, we recommend enabling cluster-autoscaling when running on a commercial cloud provider.

## Runtime requirements

### DNS

Gitpod requires a domain (or sub-domain on a domain) that is resolvable by your name servers. As Gitpod launches services and workspaces on additional subdomains it also needs two wildcard domains.

For example:

```
your-domain.com
*.your-domain.com
*.ws.your-domain.com
```

or

```
gitpod.your-domain.com
*.gitpod.your-domain.com
*.ws.gitpod.your-domain.com
```

### Ingress

- Gitpod is designed to serve traffic directly to your local network or internet.
- Wrapping Gitpod Self-Hosted behind proxies such as nginx or configurations where URLs are rewritten are not supported.

### SSL

- Gitpod requires trusted HTTPS certificates. While there is no hard requirement on any certificate authority, we recommend using an [ACME certificate](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#acme-challenges) issuer (such as [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com) or [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)) to automatically renew and install certificates as we do for [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io).
- Installation of Gitpod with SSL certificates signed with your own CA are not currently supported. This scenario is desired and we would welcome help getting [this community pull-request](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/2984) merged.
- The HTTPS certificates for your domain must include `your-domain.com`, `*.your-domain.com` and `*.ws.your-domain.com`. Beware that wildcard certificates are valid for one level only (i.e. `*.a.com` is not valid for `c.b.a.com`)

### Storage

- Either Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3 or MinIO Storage.

### Database

- Gitpod uses a MySQL database to store user data.
- By default Gitpod ships with a MySQL database built-in and data is stored using a Kubernetes PersistentVolume.
- For production settings, we recommend operating your own MySQL database (version v5.7 or newer).

## Supported web browsers

Gitpod Self-Hosted works with the following browsers:

- Mozilla Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Apple Safari (iPad OS and Desktop)
- Microsoft Edge (Chromium)

# Troubleshooting Gitpod Self-Hosted

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../latest) instead.

This section should solve all errors that might come up during installation of Gitpod.

## 1. `ws-daemon` is stuck in `Init: 0/1`

`kubectl describe pod ws-daemon-...` gives:
`MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "node-fs1" : hostPath type check failed: /run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux/k8s.io is not a directory`

### Solution

1.  `ssh` onto the node, `mount | grep rootfs` and find the directory where your containers are stored. Common paths are:

    - `/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux/k8s.io`
    - `/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux/moby`
    - `/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/k8s.io`

2.  _Merge_ the following into your `values.custom.yaml`:

    ```
    components:
      wsDaemon:
        containerRuntime:
          nodeRoots:
          - <your path here>
    ```

3.  Do an `helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0` to apply the changes.

> Example: For `k3s` a common configuration looks like this:

```yaml
components:
  wsDaemon:
    containerRuntime:
      containerd:
        socket: /var/run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock
      nodeRoots:
        - /var/run/k3s/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/k8s.io
```

## 2. `helm install` fails with: "minio access key is required, please add a value to your values.yaml"

Since `0.7.0` minio requires custom credentials to be configured.

### Solution

1.  Follow the [Upgrade Guide](./updating).

## 3. After upgrade, the `minio` Pod is stuck in `ContainerCreating`

This is caused by a bug in the minio Helm chart which blocks itself on updates.

### Solution

1.  `kubectl scale deployments/minio --replicas=0`

1.  `kubectl scale deployments/minio --replicas=1`

1.  Wait until the pod comes up.

## 3. `agent-smith` daemonset fails in deployment

In the v0.10.0 release `agent-smith` is [incorrectly enabled](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/4885#issuecomment-884205801) in Gitpod Self-Hosted.

### Solution

Add the following to your `values.yaml` file to disable agent-smith:

```yaml
components:
  agentSmith:
    disabled: true
```

## 4. Workspaces stopping once container image downloaded

This may be caused by your host operating system not supporting shiftfs. Check the `ws-daemon` logs for an error message like `"error","message":"cannot mount shiftfs mark"` to confirm.

Further proof can be found by checking if the shiftfs kernel module is present on your host operating system:

```shell
find /lib/modules/ -name '*shiftfs*'
```

If this returns nothing, shiftfs is not supported by your instance and you will need to use fuse instead.

### Solution

Add the following to your `values.yaml` file to use fuse-overlayfs:

```yaml
components:
  wsDaemon:
    userNamespaces:
      fsShift: fuse
```

## 5. Create workspace results in `7 PERMISSION_DENIED: cannot resolve workspace image` error

<!-- svelte-ignore a11y-img-redundant-alt -->

![Request createWorkspace failed with message: 7 PERMISSION_DENIED: cannot resolve workspace image: not authorized Unknown Error](../../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/troubleshooting/registry-unauthorized.jpeg)

If you are using the internal Docker registry, you will need to specify the username and password so your Gitpod instance can access it.

### Solution

Add the following to your `values.yaml` file to authorize the Docker registry:

```yaml
components:
  docker-registry:
    authentication:
      username: gitpod
      password: gitpod
```

> Replace these with your own values.

# Updating Gitpod Self-Hosted

> ⚠️ **Deprecated Content**
>
> The content of this page assumes you are using Helm, which is now deprecated. Please use the [Installer](../latest) instead.

## Upgrading Gitpod from v0.9.0 to v0.10.0

### default registry now requires password and username

Gitpod by default ships with an in-cluster docker-registry. If you use that one (instead of an external one), add the following to your `values.custom.yaml`:

```yaml
docker-registry:
  authentication:
    username: gitpod
    password: your-registry-password
```

Afterwards, a full redeploy is required (your DB and workspace state is kept in a PV):

```bash
helm del gitpod
helm upgrade --install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0
```

### Certificate file names changed

The file names we expect in a secret has changed. Before we'd require the default names Let's Encrypt would use. Since 0.10.0 we require a `tls.key` and a `tls.crt`.
To adjust this in your existing installation:

1. execute the following inside your config folder:

```
mv secrets/https-certificates/fullchain.pem secrets/https-certificates/tls.crt
mv secrets/https-certificates/privkey.pem secrets/https-certificates/tls.key
```

2. Upgrade your installation again:

```bash
helm install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.10.0
```

## Upgrading Gitpod from v0.8.0 to v0.10.0

With version 0.10.0 there is one change that requires user action regarding the RabbitMQ messagebus:

### RabbitMQ now requires explicitly set password and username

Gitpod uses a RabbitMQ installation for distributing messages between components. So far that has been using default credentials if not configured otherwise. With v0.10.0 this is now explicitly required.
To do so add the following to your `values.custom.yaml`:

```
rabbitmq:
  auth:
    username: your-rabbitmq-user
    password: your-secret-rabbitmq-password
```

If this is not present, `helm` will fail with the following message:

> RabbitMQ username is required, please add a value to your values.yaml or with the helm flag --set rabbitmq.auth.username=xxxxx

## Upgrading Gitpod from v0.6.0 to v0.7.0

With version 0.7.0 there are two major changes that require a user action. Both relate to the remote storage.

### Built-in MinIO is now accessible at minio.your-gitpod-domain.com

When you install Gitpod on your own Kubernetes installation, it brings a built-in MinIO object storage (unless disabled). As of v0.7.0, the built-in MinIO instance is accessible at https://minio.your-gitpod-domain.com. That's the reason that (for security reasons) we do not set a default access and secret key for the built-in MinIO installation anymore. That means, you need to add your own random keys in your values files like this:

```
minio:
  accessKey: add-a-radom-access-key-here
  secretKey: add-a-radom-secret-key-here
```

If you don't do this, `helm` will fail with the following message:

> minio access key is required, please add a value to your values.yaml

### Remote storage config has been moved to a new component

If you have a custom remote storage config (e.g. you use your own MinIO instance or the Google Cloud Storage), you need to move the config from the component `wsDaemon` to the new component `contentService`. See the [Storage Guide](./configuration/storage) for an example.

# Install Gitpod in an Air Gapped Network

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**
>
> The last official update of this product is the [November 2022 self-hosted release](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). We no longer sell commercial self-hosted licenses. If you want to self-host Gitpod, you can still request our [free community license](https://www.gitpod.io/community-license). However, we no longer offer support or updates for it. If you are interested in an isolated, private installation of Gitpod, take a look at [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated).
> Read [our blog on Gitpod Dedicated](/blog/introducing-gitpod-dedicated) to learn why we made the decision to discontinue self-hosted.

> **Note:** Installing Gitpod in an air gapped network is a feature limited to our [Professional Plan](https://www.gitpod.io/self-hosted). We support air-gap mode for paying customers only.

In this guide, we expect you to have a cluster up and running that [meets the requirements](../requirements) and have the [required components](../requirements) installed and configured (at least cert-manager is needed).

## Preparation

Before you can start with the installation, you need to prepare the following:

1. You need to have a Docker registry available in your network where you can push images to and where your Kubernetes cluster can pull images from.
1. You need to download installation bundles.

We provide you with a URL and password to a download portal. There you will find the following bundles that you need to download:

1. KOTS CLI package `kots_linux_amd64.tar.gz` <br/> (provides you with the `kubectl kots` CLI binary)
2. KOTS Airgap Bundle `kotsadm.tar.gz` <br/> (provides you with the Docker images you need for the Gitpod KOTS installer)
3. Gitpod Airgap Bundle `gitpod-<version>.airgap` <br/> (provides you with the Gitpod Docker images)

![kots-airgap-download](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-airgap-download.png)

Copy the KOTS CLI package as well as the KOTS Airgap Bundle to the machine where you are able to run `kubectl`.

## Install KOTS CLI

Unpack the KOTS CLI package `kots_linux_amd64.tar.gz`, rename the binary `kots` to `kubectl-kots`, and copy it to `/usr/local/bin/` (or to any other folder that is in your `PATH`).

Now, you should be able to run the following command:

```shell
$ kubectl kots help
```

## Install Gitpod

At first, you need to push the images that are needed for the installation admin console to your registry.

```bash
$ kubectl kots admin-console push-images \
    ./kotsadm.tar.gz \
    <registry> \
    --registry-username <username> \
    --registry-password <password>
```

Replace the following placeholder:

| Placeholder  |                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<registry>` | The registry URI in the form `<host>:<port>/<namespace>`,<br/> e.g. `my-registry.example.com:443/gitpod`. |
| `<username>` | The username for the registry that has write access (is allowed to push).                                 |
| `<password>` | The password to the username.                                                                             |

Next, you can start installing Gitpod like this:

```bash
$ kubectl kots install gitpod \
    --kotsadm-namespace <namespace> \
    --kotsadm-registry <registry> \
    --registry-username <username> \
    --registry-password <password>
```

Replace the following placeholder:

| Placeholder   |                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<namespace>` | Namespace that is used in the registry URI above.                        |
| `<registry>`  | The hostname of your registry, e.g. `my-registry.example.com:443`.       |
| `<username>`  | The username for the registry that has read access (is allowed to pull). |
| `<password>`  | The password to the username.                                            |

You will be asked for the namespace you want to install Gitpod to as well as a password for the admin console. After some time, you will see the following output:

```
  • Press Ctrl+C to exit
  • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console
```

Open your favorite browser and go to `http://localhost:8800` (port `8800` is opened on your node on `localhost` only--you may want to forward the port to your workstation in order to access the admin console).

Now, you will be asked for the password and the license. On the next page, you have to set:

- the hostname of your registry (e.g. `my-registry.example.com:443`),
- username and password (read access), as well as
- the namespace that you used in the registry URI above (e.g. `gitpod`).

Click on “choose a bundle to upload” and select your `gitpod-<version>.airgap` file on your local computer. Then hit the “Upload airgap bundle” button.

![kots-airgap-upload](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-airgap-upload.png)

Uploading this file and pushing the images to your registry will take a while (could take several hours depending on your internet connection). Grab a cup of coffee or tea and wait for it to be ready. ☕

Once the images has been pushed to your registry, you can continue to install Gitpod as described in the [installation guide](../installing-gitpod). Happy coding!

In this guide, we expect you to have a cluster up and running that [meets the requirements](../requirements) and has the [required components](../requirements) installed and configured (at least cert-manager is needed).

This guide assumes that you are using our default installation method from our [installation guide](../installing-gitpod).

## Rationale

Gitpod self-hosted is built to work by default, but it also has to be incredibly flexible. Our installation defaults will work for the vast majority of users, but there will be occassions when it does not. In order to add more flexibility, you have the ability to customise some of Gitpod's components.

In your KOTS dashboard, you will need to enable advanced options. This will enable the "Components" section.

![kots-advanced](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-advanced.png)

### Proxy service type

All web traffic enters the application through the `Proxy` component. By default, this is a `LoadBalancer` type which will expose the application through the cloud provider's load balancer.

Under certain circumstances, this may be undesirable. Under the "Advanced" section, you may select a different service type - all [Kubernetes service types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) are supported, except `ExternalName`. If you are using anything other than `LoadBalancer`, you are responsible for configuring your network to route traffic through to the `proxy` service.

# Applying custom annotations, labels and environment variables

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**
>
> The last official update of this product is the [November 2022 self-hosted release](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). We no longer sell commercial self-hosted licenses. If you want to self-host Gitpod, you can still request our [free community license](https://www.gitpod.io/community-license). However, we no longer offer support or updates for it.

In this guide, we expect you to have a cluster up and running that [meets the requirements](../requirements) and has the [required components](../requirements) installed and configured (at least cert-manager is needed).

This guide assumes that you are using our default installation method from our [installation guide](../installing-gitpod).

## Rationale

There are times when it is necessary to add custom annotations, environment variables and labels to your installation in order to add it to your environment. For example, one may need to support specific monitoring and observability software or want to target a specific load balancer type.

## Configuration

Before you start, you will need to create a YAML file that is subsequently used to describe your customizations. The structure is based upon the standard Kubernetes resource definition.

Once created, this file can be uploaded to the Installation Admin UI during installation under the advanced features section (bottom).

![kots-advanced-customization](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-advanced-customization.png)

### Annotations and labels

For these to be applied to a resource, these must match the `apiVersion`, `kind` and `metadata.name` properties of the target resource. These accept any value that is valid as per the Kubernetes specifications and also an `*` as a wildcard.

Any properties in `metadata.annotations` and `metadata.labels` are then applied to the matching resource(s). These are key/value maps, where both key and value are strings.

**IMPORTANT** You cannot directly customize the properties on a `Pod`. Instead, these will inherit the annotation/label customization from its parent (`Deployment`, `DaemonSet`, `StatefulSet`, `Job` etc).

### Environment variables

For environment variables, these must match `metadata.name`. `apiVersion` and `kind` are ignored as these are only implemented on resources with containers.

Any properties in `spec.env` are then applied. These should have a `name` and `value` as per the Kubernetes specification.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
customization:
  - apiVersion: "*"
    kind: "*"
    metadata:
      name: "*"
      annotations:
        appliedToAll: value
        hello: world
      labels:
        appliedToAll: value
        hello: world
  - apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind: "Deployment"
    metadata:
      name: "ws-manager"
      annotations:
        hello: ws-manager
      labels:
        hello: ws-manager
    spec:
      env:
        - name: HELLO
          value: world
```

This example would generate the following spec (these are simplified for readability reasons):

```yaml
---
# apps/v1/DaemonSet ws-daemon
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app: gitpod # system-value
    component: ws-daemon # system-value
    appliedToAll: value
    hello: world
  annotations:
    appliedToAll: value
    hello: world
  name: ws-daemon

In the event of multiple matches, the final matching customization is applied. Therefore, it is a good idea to structure your customization from least to most specific.

> **Important:** System-generated values will never be overridden.

## AWS Proxy Service Example

This is an example configuration for working with [AWS Load Balancer Controllers](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/) of the [Network Load Balancer](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/guide/service/nlb/) variety, when deployed in [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). This example creates a load balancer with a public IP, references two subnets: `[subnet-012e8ff1de0654321,subnet-0a6d28629bc123456]`, tunes timeouts, and ensures the tags `project:gitpod-docs` and `team:cs` are applied to the AWS resources it creates.

```yaml
---
customization:
  - apiVersion: "*"
    kind: "Service"
    metadata:
      name: "proxy"
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internet-facing"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: "instance"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-subnets: "subnet-012e8ff1de0654321,subnet-0a6d28629bc123456"
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: "idle_timeout.timeout_seconds=3600"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-additional-resource-tags: "project=gitpod-docs,team=cs"
```

## Limitations

> This limitation has been removed as of [`2022.08.0`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/releases/tag/2022.08.0).

Labels are immutable on some Kubernetes resources, such as `Deployments`, `DaemonSets` and `StatefulSets`.

If you wish to change a label on one of these resources, you must destroy that resource first. This can be achieved by running `kubectl delete <resource> --namespace <namespace> <name>` prior to running the KOTS deployment.

In the event of there being multiple resources that need to be amended, you can run `helm uninstall --namespace <namespace> gitpod`. If you are using an in-cluster database or object storage, you should not run this command without taking a backup of your persistent volumes first.

> **WARNING:** If deleting Kubernetes resources, your Gitpod instance is likely to become inaccessible and unstable. This should not be attempted while it is being used for normal development as data loss is likely.

This guide describes how to set a default workspace image that will apply to your entire Gitpod Self-Hosted installation. Please refer to the [Docker image documentation](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) for more information about workspace images.

> **Note:** there are two ways of setting an image for a workspace: via the installation-wide default `workspaceImage` (mentioned here) and the [`.gitpod.yml` file](/docs/references/gitpod-yml). The `.gitpod.yml` file will take precedence if both are set.

## Setting a default workspace image

> **Note:** this will apply to your entire installation. If you are using a private registry for your image, please ensure you add it to the allow list and provide credentials for it - for guidance, see [using private registries](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/advanced/private-registries).

Currently, the default workspace image can only be set via the [config patch](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches). In the future, we plan to also allow you to set this via the installation UI.

```yaml
workspace:
  workspaceImage: string

If you are unable to use an AWS classic load balancer (CLB) (e.g. because you want to use SSL Certificates generated by AWS) you need to set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTPS traffic (e.g. when using VS Code in the browser). If you wish to use Desktop IDEs together with Gitpod Self-Hosted, which use SSH for networking, and thus require a Level 4 load balancer, you also need to create a Network Load balancer (NLB) (which is a Level 4 load balancer that can handle ssh traffic). AWS' ALB is a level 7 load balancer and can only handle HTTPS traffic.

This guide shows how to install both an ALB and an NLB into an EKS cluster. It is meant to be used as a supplement to the [Single Cluster Reference Architecture (AWS)](../reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) which only installs a CLB by default. You will configure your DNS to point ssh traffic to the NLB and HTTPS traffic to the ALB.

> **Note:** This guide assumes that you will be using AWS to manage your SSL certificates.

## Setting up an ALB and NLB

### 0. Node configuration

Because we need to use an internal CA for communication that has to be distributed to the nodes, we need to ensure all managed nodes have `/etc/containerd/certs.d` in their `/etc/containerd/config.toml` to load the self-signed certificate used for internal communication.

```toml
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry]
  config_path = "/etc/containerd/certs.d"
```

These are two examples to enforce this:

1. Use python to insert the values into the toml file respecting the formatting:

```shell
apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install toml mergedeep
/usr/bin/env python3 - << EOF > /var/log/update-containerd-config-out.txt 2>&1
import toml
from mergedeep import merge
c = toml.load('/etc/containerd/config.toml')
merge(c, {'plugins': {'io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri': {'registry': {'config_path': '/etc/containerd/certs.d'}}}})
with open('/etc/containerd/config.toml', 'w') as f:
  toml.dump(c, f)
EOF
service containerd restart
```

2. Bruteforce method that will just append the lines to `/etc/containerd/config.toml` which will work if there are no other registry settings present in your config.toml file

```
cat << CONFIG >> /etc/containerd/config.toml

[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry]
config_path = "/etc/containerd/certs.d"

CONFIG

service containerd restart
```

</details>

### 1. Install AWS load balancer controller

Install the AWS [load balancer controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/). The below example assumes you have created the user `aws-load-balancer-controller` with the correct [IAM permissions already](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html). `--set hostNetwork=true` is required by Calico.

```shell
helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
helm repo update
helm upgrade aws-load-balancer-controller \
    eks/aws-load-balancer-controller \
    --atomic \
    --cleanup-on-fail \
    --install \
    --reset-values \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --set clusterName=<insert cluster name> \
    --set serviceAccount.create=false \
    --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer-controller \
    --set hostNetwork=true
```

### 2. Install Gitpod

Ensure that you've created all the required components as per [the reference architecture guide](../reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch): [Object Storage](../reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch#object-storage), [OCI Image Registry](../reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch#oci-image-registry), [Database](../reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch#database). Then [install Gitpod](../reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch#install-gitpod). While configuring your Gitpod installation, make sure to check 'use self-signed certificate'. Make sure that you select `node port` as the service type for the proxy service in the components section of the installation UI (this assumes you are using version 2022.07 or later):

![proxy service type](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/proxy-service-type-ui.png)

You will also need to make sure that the "allow login via SSH" box is ticked:

![ssh gateway](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/ssh-gateway.png)

### 3. Create alb-ingresss.yaml

Update the `alb-ingress.yaml` below with your site-specific options (you need to customize anything tagged with `<..>`):

**alb-ingress.yaml**

```yaml
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.ssl-redirect: |-
      {
        "Type": "redirect",
        "RedirectConfig": {
          "Protocol": "HTTPS",
          "Port": "443",
          "StatusCode": "HTTP_301"
        }
      }
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-protocol: HTTPS
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: |-
      [{
        "HTTP": 80
      }, {
        "HTTPS": 443
      }]
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: idle_timeout.timeout_seconds=3600
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/tags: Purpose=Gitpod,Service=proxy
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes: deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds=30

    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: <SET THIS -> internet-facing or internal>
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-name: <GITPOD-LOAD-BALANCER-NAME>
  name: gitpod
spec:
  defaultBackend:
    service:
      name: proxy
      port:
        number: 80
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              service:
                name: proxy
                port:
                  number: 443
            path: /
            pathType: Prefix
```

### 4. Install ALB and NLB

Install the ALB (for HTTPS traffic) and NLB (for SSH traffic) using the .yaml file customized above as well as this one:

**nlb-ssh-service.yaml**

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: gitpod-ssh
  labels:
    app: gitpod
    component: ws-proxy-ssh
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-name: gitpod-ssh-gateway
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: external
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: "instance"
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ip-address-type: ipv4
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: tcp
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-target-node-labels: gitpod.io/workload_workspace_services=true
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-target-group-attributes: stickiness.enabled=true,stickiness.type=source_ip,preserve_client_ip.enabled=true
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-additional-resource-tags: Project=gitpod-alb
spec:
  ports:
    - name: ssh
      protocol: TCP
      port: 22
      targetPort: 2200
  selector:
    app: gitpod
    component: ws-proxy
  type: LoadBalancer
```

```
kubectl apply -f alb-ingress.yaml
kubectl apply -f nlb-ssh-service.yaml
```

### 5. Check if installed properly

If installed properly, then this should be the shell output given the command below:

```bash
> kubectl get ingress gitpod -n gitpod
NAME     CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS                                                   PORTS   AGE
gitpod   <none>   *       gitpod-airgap-alb-339697413.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80      41s

> kubectl get service gitpod-ssh -n gitpod
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                       PORT(S)        AGE
gitpod-ssh   LoadBalancer   172.20.162.102   gitpod-ssh-gateway-6588d186387780e5.elb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com   22:30003/TCP   76s
```

### 6. Update DNS records

Update DNS as follows to point to your newly created loadbalancers depending on the type of traffic:

```
gitpod.domain.com           --> ALB ADDRESS
*.gitpod.domain.com         --> ALB ADDRESS
*.ssh.ws.gitpod.domain.com  --> NLB ADDRESS
```

This guide outlines the considerations to take when using images for workspaces that originate from private image registries that are not stored in the image registry already configured in the KOTS Installation UI. This is useful when, for example, you want to pull private base images from one registry and then store the built images in another.

Please refer to the [Docker image documentation](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) for more information about workspace images.

> **Note:** there are two ways of setting an image for a workspace: via the installation-wide [default `workspaceImage`](./default-workspace-image) and the [`.gitpod.yml` file](/docs/references/gitpod-yml). The `.gitpod.yml` file will take precedence if both are set.

## Credentials

To access private registries, Gitpod needs to have the corresponding access credentials. These can be supplied in the KOTS installation UI:

![registry credentials UI](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/private-registry-credentials.png)

## Allowlist

Gitpod also has an allow list for private base image registries. Any private image registry that is used throughout an installation needs to be on this allowlist.

> **Important:** Any registry for which credentials are supplied is automatically added to this allowlist!

Registries can be added to the allowlist via the [config patch](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches) in the following format:

```yaml
containerRegistry:
  privateBaseImageAllowList:
    - <your_registry-url.com>
    - <another_registry-url.com>
```

Gitpod has three resource dependencies that are required to function correctly. For convenience, you can use the in-cluster dependencies, but you should use external resources for a high-performance application.

This page highlights some of the common gotchas found when working with cloud resources and how to overcome them.

## Container Registry

### [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

Amazon ECR does not fully implement the [Docker v2 API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api), namely it does not automatically create the remote image if it does not already exist when pushed. For that reason, ECR is not supported with Gitpod.

When using AWS, you should select an in-cluster registry and use S3 as your in-cluster storage provider. This will use the in-cluster registry as a facade for an S3 bucket where all the images will be stored.

If using a region other than `us-east-1`, you will need to change the endpoint to be `s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`.

### [Google Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)

> This example uses the format `gcr.io`, which is the global hostnames. This can be swapped with any of the [regional hostnames](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling) and it will work in the same way.

Google Container Registry authentication requires specific configuration. The "Container registry URL" will be in a format similar to `gcr.io/<project-name>/gitpod`. In order for the authentication to work, you must also enter the "Container registry server". This will always be your GCR hostname, eg `gcr.io`.

### [Google Artifact Registry (GAR)](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry)

As with [GCR](#google-container-registry-gcr), Google Artifact Registry requires both the "Container registry URL" and "Container registry server" to be completed. The URL will be in the format `<region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project-name>/gitpod` and the server address will be `<region>-docker.pkg.dev`.

# TLS configuration for Gitpod Self-Hosted

To run your own Gitpod instance, you need a TLS certificate for your Gitpod domain. There are three options to provide these TLS certificates.

## Option 1: Cert-Manager

Configure cert-manager to issue these certificates (usually with a DNS-01 challenge and services like [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)). See the [installation guide](../installing-gitpod#prerequisites)) for more information.

![kots-tls-cert-manager](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-tls-cert-manager.png)

<p align="center"><em>TLS certificates configuration options during the installation process</em></p>

## Option 2: Self-signed by Gitpod

_We usually do not recommend this option for production usage._

Let Gitpod generate self-signed certificates for your installation. This option can be used in case your load balancer does the TLS termination or for testing settings. For the latter case, you need to add the custom [CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) to your browser to let it accept the self-signed certificate. Use this command to export the CA:

```
$ kubectl get secrets -n <namespace> ca-issuer-ca -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ~/ca.crt
```

![kots-tls-self-signed](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-tls-self-signed.png)

## Option 3: Bring your own certificate

> ⚠️ **Limitation**
>
> Adding custom CA certificates is currently _not_ supported on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** because on GKE `containerd` does not support custom certificates.

Upload your own TLS certificate, key, and (optionally) CA certificate. When your TLS certificate is signed by a publicly accepted TLS authority, you just need to upload your certificate and key. In case it is a self-signed certificate (e.g. signed by a corporate CA), you also need to upload your CA.

For [business continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning) purposes, it is important to think about how you might restore your ability to use Gitpod, and thus develop software in the event of a catastrophic failure of Gitpod or the underlying infrastructure it runs on. This guide assumes that you will use the backup and restore strategy for disaster recovery and will guide you towards what needs to be backed up and how to restore using said backup. Please see our background reading on [disaster recovery](./disaster-recovery) for more information.

> **Important:** When using Gitpod in a production setting, we recommend you base your installation on the [single cluster reference architecture](./reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch). Using in-cluster dependencies is not recommended because there is no means to produce backups, and the database/storages systems are within failure domain of the cluster. If possible consider using Gitpod [SaaS](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing).

> **Note:** We recommend to regularly trial run a recovery using this method to ensure that it works in practice and to allow yourself the chance to spot any unforeseen issues.

## What to back up

It is critical to consider what needs to be backed up and ensure you take the necessary steps to secure each of the listed elements. What needs to be backed up is closely aligned with [Gitpod’s architecture](./reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch#overview) and how it runs.

### Database

The database is a central component in Gitpod where all metadata about users and workspaces, as well as settings of the Gitpod instance (such as auth providers) are stored. This makes the database a critical component. In case of a database outage, you are not able to log in, use the Gitpod dashboard, or start workspaces. We recommend using a cloud provider native relational database service that supports MySQL - see [required components](./requirements). This means that you can rely on the best practices of each service for disaster recovery. For example:

- **AWS Relational Database Service**: You can rely on RDS’s [backup and restore mechanisms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_CommonTasks.BackupRestore.html) and set it up to run in [multiple availability zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/create-multi-az-db-cluster.html) to allow for higher availability. You can also consider other [disaster best practices](https://medium.com/tensult/amazon-rds-disaster-recovery-8a40dd8350ea).
- **Google Cloud SQL:** You can rely on Cloud SQLs [backup and restore features](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/backup-recovery/backups) and run the instance in a [high availability configuration](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability) to decrease the chance of failure. You can also refer to the general [Google Cloud disaster recovery best practices](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/dr-scenarios-planning-guide).

### Object Storage

Gitpod uses **object storage** to store blob data. This includes workspace backups created when a workspace stops and are used to restore the state upon restart. As such, to secure the work of your users, it is critical to think about backing up this data and/or relying on the best practices for disaster recovery of the object storage service being used. For example:

- **AWS S3:** You can consider using [cross-region replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html) to increase reliability further - although S3 already stores your data across multiple geographically distant _Availability Zones_ by default.
- **Google Cloud Storage:** Consider using the [Multi-Regional Storage option](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) for additional availability.

### OCI Image Registry

Gitpod uses an image registry to cache images and store images it builds on behalf of users. _Note: For non-airgapped environments, this is **not** the registry that contains the images of Gitpod’s services._ As such, losing this data means that workspace starts may take longer because images need to be re-built. Consider implementing best practices for securing the registry you are using.

### Application Config

> **Important:** KOTS Snapshots will **NOT** save any data from your Gitpod database, registry or object storage. It will also not backup any data outside of your `gitpod` namespace. It will backup:
>
> - the KOTS dashboard
> - the KOTS configuration
> - the version of Gitpod installed
> - the TLS certificate generated by cert-manager (if enabled)

Although you could simply re-install Gitpod using the regular [installation path](./installing-gitpod), this can take some time and you would need to re-configure it to the state you had last had it in. To minimize your recovery time, you can persist the application configuration (ideally regularly).

#### Configuring Velero

[Velero](https://velero.io/) is an open source tool to safely backup and restore, perform disaster recovery, and migrate Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. It is used by KOTS to connect to your backup location. It supports many [data sources](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/snapshots-storage-destinations), including AWS, Azure and GCP storage solutions.

Please follow the installation instructions as per the [Velero documentation](https://velero.io/docs/latest/basic-install). KOTS requires [Restic integration](https://velero.io/docs/v1.9/restic) to function correctly, which can be added by appending the `--use-restic` flag to the `velero install` command.

#### Triggering Your First Backup

> For full documentation on the KOTS backup solution, please see their [documentation](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/snapshots-understanding).

To create a new backup via the KOTS CLI or in the Snapshots section of your KOTS dashboard, you can do this by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl kots backup --namespace gitpod
```

When that has finished, you will be able to list your backups:

```bash
kubectl kots backup ls
```

And it will display a list that looks similar to this:

```bash
NAME              STATUS       ERRORS    WARNINGS    STARTED                          COMPLETED                        EXPIRES
instance-ab1cd    Completed    0         0           2022-08-11 13:36:38 +0100 BST    2022-08-11 13:36:54 +0100 BST    29d
```

### Cluster Configuration

To reduce the time it takes you to re-create a cluster, you can move to an infrastructure as code flow, e.g. by codifying the infrastructure you need using Terraform.

## How to restore

The following explains how you might restore Gitpod after its underlying cluster fails.

1. Recreate your infrastructure. Ideally, you do this using something like a Terraform script.
2. Configure Velero using the instructions [above](#configuring-velero) - it is recommended that you install the same version that you used previously.
3. List your available backups using:

```bash
kubectl kots backup ls
```

4. Restore the backup using:

```bash
kubectl kots restore --from-backup instance-ab1cd
```

5. Load the KOTS dashboard:

```bash
kubectl kots admin-console --namespace gitpod
```

6. Hit the "Redeploy" button.
7. This should result in your Gitpod instance having the same state as before, thus allowing your users to pick up where they left off.

## Security considerations

### Application Config

Velero should be configured so that is deployed to a different namespace to Gitpod. The Velero deployment will contain secrets which will allow access to your backup source of choice. Your Kubernetes cluster should be configured to limit access to these resources with use of a role-based access policy (RBAC).

You should always consult with the Velero documentation to ensure that you are following their best practice guidelines to ensure the integrity of your backup artifacts.

# Cluster Requirements

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**
>
> The last official update of this product is the [November 2022 self-hosted release](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). We no longer sell commercial self-hosted licenses. If you want to self-host Gitpod, you can still request our [free community license](https://www.gitpod.io/community-license). However, we no longer offer support or updates for it.

Gitpod is a Kubernetes application running with certain expectations on the characteristics of the cluster it is running on.

![cluster requirements](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/cluster-requirements.png)

<!-- raw editable diagram can be found under static/images/docs/self-hosted/cluster-requirements.excalidraw -->

## Reference Architectures

We have created a set of [reference architectures](../latest/reference-architecture) for all the major cloud providers that fulfil the requirements below. These are intended as a starting point for you to create an environment to install Gitpod into. If you wish to use K3s, please refer to the [k3s guide](../latest/cluster-set-up/on-k3s).

## Supported Kubernetes Distributions

Gitpod requires Kubernetes as an orchestration technology in order to spin workspaces up and down--ideally in combination with cluster autoscaling to minimize cost. We strongly recommend deploying a dedicated Kubernetes cluster just for Gitpod Self-Hosted.

> Kubernetes version `1.21` or above is required

Gitpod Self-Hosted runs well on:

- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
- Google Kubernetes Engine
- Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service
- K3s

### Incompatible Kubernetes Distributions

These platforms do not currently work with Gitpod Self-Hosted but we would like to support them in the future. Gitpod is an open-source project, maybe you could contribute the required changes to help get them working sooner?

- [Red Hat® OpenShift®](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5409)
- [Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5410)

If you are considering purchasing a commercial license for Gitpod Self-Hosted and need one of the above platforms then please [contact us](/contact/sales) to start discussions about making support for them happen sooner.

## Node Affinity Labels Requirements

Your Kubernetes cluster must have node(s) with the following labels applied to them:

- `gitpod.io/workload_meta=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_ide=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_services=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_regular=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_headless=true`

It is recommended to have a minimum of two node pools, grouping the `meta` and `ide` nodes into one node pool and `workspace` related nodes into another. These two groups of workloads have different performance characteristics. Separating them into node pools after the fact is more difficult and incurs downtime.

## Node and Container Requirements

These are the components expected on each node:

- Either Ubuntu 18.04 with ≥ v5.4 kernel or Ubuntu 20.04 with ≥ v5.4 kernel
- Calico for the networking overlay and network policy
- Containerd ≥ 1.5
- At least 4 vCPU and 16GB of RAM

## Kubernetes Privilege Requirements

Your Kubernetes cluster must allow Gitpod to run privileged pods and manage PodSecurityPolicies, as Gitpod depends on these privileges to provide workspace isolation.

## Load Balancer Requirements

Gitpod uses [`LoadBalancer` type services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) to expose the Gitpod Dashboard, browser-based IDEs, and SSH connections used by desktop IDEs. Your Kubernetes cluster must be able to provision layer 4 or layer 7 load balancers for `LoadBalancer` type services that can route HTTP(S) connections to Gitpod services. If you intend to use desktop IDEs or SSH to workspaces then your cluster must also be able to provision layer 4 load balancers that can route SSH connection to Gitpod services.

All supported Kubernetes distributions provide load balancers that meet Gitpod's needs. For more information see the Kubernetes distribution documentation below:

- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service-load-balancer)
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Engine:
  - Layer 4/7 (default): [Classic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/eks-kubernetes-services-cluster/)
  - Layer 4 only: [Network Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-load-balancing.html)
- [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-network)
- [K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/networking/#service-load-balancer)

# How to Create a Cluster with K3s

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**
>
> The last official update of this product is the [November 2022 self-hosted release](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). We no longer sell commercial self-hosted licenses. If you want to self-host Gitpod, you can still request our [free community license](https://www.gitpod.io/community-license). However, we no longer offer support or updates for it. If you are interested in an isolated, private installation of Gitpod, take a look at [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated).
> Read [our blog on Gitpod Dedicated](/blog/introducing-gitpod-dedicated) to learn why we made the decision to discontinue self-hosted.

In this guide, we show you how to set up a Kubernetes cluster with [K3s](https://k3s.io/) that is ready to install Gitpod. In this example we expect to have at least 2 nodes with Ubuntu 20.04 (a single node setup would work as well, see hint below):

- `node0`: main node where the Gitpod service pods will be deployed to
- `node1`: worker node where the Gitpod workspace pods will be deployed to
- optional: one or more additional worker nodes `node2` … `nodeN`

On each node, we [install K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/). We configure K3s by setting the following environment variables on the nodes.

K3s config for main node `node0`:

```shell
export INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="server --disable traefik --flannel-backend=none --node-label gitpod.io/workload_meta=true --node-label gitpod.io/workload_ide=true"
export K3S_CLUSTER_SECRET="<your random secret string that is the same on all nodes>"
```

K3s config for all other nodes:

```shell
export INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="agent --node-label gitpod.io/workload_workspace_services=true --node-label gitpod.io/workload_workspace_regular=true --node-label gitpod.io/workload_workspace_headless=true"
export K3S_CLUSTER_SECRET="<your random secret string that is the same on all nodes>"
export K3S_URL="https://node0:6443"
```

**Hint:** _In case you would like to set up a single node cluster (only the main node) add the `--node-label` arguments of the bottom "other" nodes config to the `INSTALL_K3S_EXEC` variable of the main node config._

After setting the environment variables, install K3s on every node like this:

```shell
$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

Now, you have to install [Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/). Download the [Calico manifest](https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico-vxlan.yaml) and add the following line to the `plugins` section of the `cni_network_config`:

```json
"container_settings": { "allow_ip_forwarding": true }
```

The section in the `calico-vxlan.yaml` file should look like this:

```json
[...]
  cni_network_config: |-
    {
      "name": "k8s-pod-network",
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "plugins": [
        {
          "type": "calico",
          "log_level": "info",
          "log_file_path": "/var/log/calico/cni/cni.log",
          "datastore_type": "kubernetes",
          "nodename": "__KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME__",
          "mtu": __CNI_MTU__,
          "ipam": {
              "type": "calico-ipam"
          },
          "policy": {
              "type": "k8s"
          },
          "kubernetes": {
              "kubeconfig": "__KUBECONFIG_FILEPATH__"
          },
          "container_settings": { "allow_ip_forwarding": true }
        },
[...]
```

Copy that file to `node0` in the following folder (create folder if missing):

```
/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/
```

That's it. Your K3s cluster is ready to install Gitpod. The next step is to install cert-manager. Just follow the instructions of the [installation guide](../installing-gitpod#prerequisites) to install !

Instructions on how to create a Microsoft AKS environment that is ready to install Gitpod are located in the [gitpod-io/gitpod-microsoft-aks-guide](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod-microsoft-aks-guide) repository on GitHub. The installation process takes around twenty minutes. In the end, the following resources are created:

- An Microsoft AKS cluster running Kubernetes v1.21.
- An Microsoft Azure load balancer.
- An Microsoft Azure DNS zone.
- An Microsoft Azure container registry.
- MySQL will be provided by Helm under [#5508](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5508) solved.
- Minio will be used until Microsoft [Azure storage gateway](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod-azure-aks-guide/issues/1) is configured.
- Installation of [calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org) as CNI and NetworkPolicy implementation
- Installation of [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for self-signed SSL certificates

Upon completion, this script will print the config for the resources created (including passwords) and what is the [next relevant step](./../installing-gitpod#install-gitpod) in the installation process. Note that you will be able to skip steps 2 and 3 in the getting started guide because the script can do these steps for you.

Further customization of your installation is possible within the installation UI, where Gitpod can provide you with a config patch to tailor the installation to your specific needs. In the “Additional Options” section, click the “Enable additional options” checkbox, and upload the file in the “Gitpod config patch” field.

![config patch](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/config-patch.png)

The patch file is effectively a patch for the internally used [Gitpod Installer config file](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/install/installer/example-config.yaml). It gives you access to all configuration options that Gitpod accepts - even those not present in the UI. All values that are set in the patch file will override the generated config file values.

# Configuring workspace resources

Configuring workspace resources and limits is essential to balancing the following factors:

- **Workspace performance:** The amount of compute available to each workspace
- **Workspace startup times:** Having smaller workspaces on a node increases the chances of there being space available for another workspace, meaning that a new node does not need to be spun up. On the other extreme: one workspace per node means a new node needs to be spun up for every new workspace
- **Your cost of compute:** The fewer resources your workspaces request, the more you can fit on the node - and the fewer nodes you have to pay for

## How to configure workspace requests and limits

> You should always be setting limits for your workspaces in order to avoid a process taking up the resources of an entire node, starving all other processes. We recommend sizing workspaces onto a node such that `4 cores` and `8 GiB of RAM` are left unused for Gitpod's services (mainly `ws-daemon`) and other processes (e.g. the kubelet).

Currently, workspace resources and limits can be set via a [config-patch](./config-patches).

For example, assuming a machine with 16 CPUs and 64 GB of memory, we recommend the following config-patch:

```yaml
workspace:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "4"
      memory: 16Gi
    limits:
      cpu: "4"
      memory: 16Gi
```

With this configuration, 3 workspaces should fit onto the aforementioned 16 CPU / 64 GB memory node (with CPU cores being the limiting factor). A workspace would always have 4 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM available. These numbers are also used when scheduling workspaces onto pods - workspaces are only scheduled onto nodes that have at least these amounts of resources available.

> This is intentionally on the conservative side due to potential resource conflicts concerning I/O bandwidth.

> **Note:** There is a lot more to disaster recovery than we can cover here. This is just a high-level overview that speaks to how disaster recovery relates to Gitpod - it does not aim to be a complete guide to the topic.

### Disaster Recovery Principles

Thinking about disaster recovery with Gitpod is essential for business continuity and compliance reasons given how critical Gitpod is within your business’ practices: it is not only used to write code for new features but also e.g. to fix a security vulnerability.

When evaluating different disaster recovery strategies, it is important to keep in mind the business impact of different strategies. This impact is often defined by these interconnected metrics:

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** this is the amount of time it takes to recover from a catastrophic failure. Applying this to Gitpod, this would be the time between a major outage that renders Gitpod unusable and the point at which Gitpod is restored and developers can develop again.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** This is the maximum amount of data loss (measured by time) during an outage that is acceptable to an organisation.
- **Acceptable Cost:** Different disaster recovery strategies come with different cost profiles. You need to know the acceptable cost level for your business to help choose the right strategy.

The accepted value of each key metric will depend on your business’ risk appetite and acceptable cost levels. These metrics can be used to better understand and categorise the different disaster recovery options available with Gitpod.

## Disaster Recovery Strategies

> **Note:** Whichever disaster recovery strategy you chose, make sure that you practice it end-to-end regularly to ensure that you can execute it successfully if ever it does become necessary.

Please refer to our guide around [backing up and restoring Gitpod](backup-restore) to learn more about which data Gitpod produces and how it can be backed up.

### Backup And Restore (Higher RTO)

With this strategy, you aim to replace a failed Gitpod instance or Kubernetes cluster by spinning up an entirely new cluster. You can find out more on how to do this in our [How to Backup and Restore Guide](backup-restore).

This strategy has the benefit of being cost-effective because you only operate a single cluster at a time. However, the time to spin up a new cluster and install Gitpod can be high increasing the time to recover. Thus, depending on your recovery time objective, it may be beneficial to evaluate the strategies mentioned below.

### Pilot Light (Medium RTO)

With this strategy, you keep a secondary Kubernetes cluster running that is identical to the one used in production - but in a separate data center and scaled down to the minimum set of nodes to save cost. This means that you do not need to first spin up a cluster in case of disaster but can rather use the one already running to install Gitpod onto (using the same external dependencies and thus data as your production cluster) and then shift traffic to. This can significantly reduce your time to recovery but comes with the cost of running an additional cluster.

# Self-Hosted

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**

Gitpod can be deployed and operated on your own infrastructure. It supports different cloud providers, self-managed Kubernetes clusters, corporate firewalls, and even off-grid / air-gapped networks.

## Local Preview

The [Local Preview](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/local-preview) installation of Gitpod Self-Hosted is the easiest way to try out Gitpod locally in situations where you cannot use the [SaaS version](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) and cannot easily spin up a Kubernetes cluster to use the Proof-of-Value [reference architecture](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture).

It is intended for preview purposes only - we strongly encourage the Kubernetes-based installation below for continuous usage.

## Prerequisites to Install Gitpod Self-Hosted

> **Note:** Gitpod is not just a simple Kubernetes application like a web shop app. It is more of an infrastructure tool comparable to a build system that heavily makes use of Kubernetes internals to build and deploy images, control Kubernetes containers (the workspaces) and more. This is why it needs more permissions in Kubernetes than a simple web app.

- **Kubernetes expertise** <br />
  Gitpod is a Kubernetes application that makes heavy use of various Kubernetes features. It is highly recommended to have sufficient Kubernetes experience in order to install Gitpod. These docs expect that you are able to create and maintain a Kubernetes cluster that meets our [requirements](./latest/requirements) on your own.

- **Compatible Kubernetes cluster** <br />
  To install Gitpod you need to have a Kubernetes cluster up and running. There are a few [requirements](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/requirements) that must be met. Please see the [product compatibility matrix](/docs/references/compatibility?admin) supported Kubernetes distributions. To help you get started, there are several different situation-dependent [reference architectures](./latest/reference-architecture) for all major cloud providers that include both a detailed guide as well as terraform configuration.

- **Cert-Manager** <br />
  Gitpod expects a properly configured [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) that runs in the cluster. It is used to issue internal certificates for the Gitpod installation and to create certificates for the Gitpod domain (unless you bring your own domain certificates).

- **DNS setup** <br />
  For your Gitpod installation you need a properly configured domain. The domain itself and the wildcard subdomain `*.example.com`, `*.ws.example.com` (replace `example.com` with your Gitpod domain) need to point to the cluster ingress.

- **Gitpod product license** <br />
  To install Gitpod, you need a license that you can get [here](/community-license).

## Installing Gitpod

The [installation guide](./latest/installing-gitpod) provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to install Gitpod on your infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting

Refer to the [troubleshooting section](./latest/troubleshooting) for help with your Gitpod Self-Hosted Instance. You can also take a look at our [support page](/support) to learn how to reach our community and support team.

# Installing Gitpod Self-Hosted

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**
>
> The last official update of this product is the [November 2022 self-hosted release](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). We no longer sell commercial self-hosted licenses. If you want to self-host Gitpod, you can still request our [free community license](https://www.gitpod.io/community-license). However, we no longer offer support or updates for it. If you are interested in an isolated, private installation of Gitpod, take a look at [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated).
> Read [our blog on Gitpod Dedicated](/blog/introducing-gitpod-dedicated) to learn why we made the decision to discontinue self-hosted.

> **Note:** Setting up a self-hosted Gitpod instance needs some Kubernetes experience. Detailed guidance on how to setup and maintain a Kubernetes cluster is behind the scope of these docs. Please also see the [_prerequisites_](./installing-gitpod#prerequisites) below.

## Prerequisites

> These prerequisites are fulfilled already if you used one of the [reference architectures](./reference-architecture). We strongly encourage the use of these reference architectures. Please see the [requirements](./requirements) for more information on what Gitpod needs to function.

<details>
  <summary  class="text-p-medium"><b> Kubernetes Cluster</b></summary>

Gitpod is a Kubernetes application that uses Kubernetes internally to provision workspaces as Kubernetes pods. Before you can start installing Gitpod, you need to create a compatible Kubernetes cluster. The [reference architectures](./reference-architecture) will help you to get started with your favorite cloud provider. If you are creating a cluster yourself, it's up to you to set up a cluster that meets the [requirements](./requirements).

</details>

<details>
  <summary  class="text-p-medium"><b>Cert-Manager installed on the cluster</b></summary>

Once you have created your Kubernetes cluster you need to install [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/). cert-manager is needed even when you bring your own TLS certificate for your domain. Please consider the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) on how to install it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary  class="text-p-medium"><b>DNS and TLS configured</b></summary>

To install Gitpod you need a domain with a TLS certificate. The DNS setup to your domain needs to be configured such that it points to the ingress of your Kubernetes cluster. You need to configure your actual domain (say `example.com`) as well as the wildcard subdomains `*.example.com` and `*.ws.example.com`. Alternatively, you can rely on a configured `Issuer`/`ClusterIssuer` plus a `Certificate` (that also includes the wildcard domains) for cert-manager:

**Creating TLS certs for your domain with cert-manager**

cert-manager provides the Gitpod installation with certificates for internal communication. Besides this, cert-manager can also create a TLS certificate for your domain. Since Gitpod needs wildcard certificates, you must use the [DNS-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge). Please consult the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01) for instructions. You can use either an [`Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer).

Following the cert-manager instructions, you will have an `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` with a configured `dns01` solver (most probably with a proper secret with credentials for your DNS provider) as well a `Certificate` with the following `dnsNames`:

- `example.com`
- `*.example.com`
- `*.ws.example.com`

_(replace `example.com` with your Gitpod domain)_

</details>

## Install Gitpod

To start with installing Gitpod, you need a terminal where you can run `kubectl` against your cluster. First, install the KOTS kubectl plugin:

```shell
curl https://kots.io/install | bash
```

Now, you are ready to install Gitpod. Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
kubectl kots install gitpod
```

You will be asked for the namespace you want to install Gitpod to as well as a password for the admin console. After some time, you will see the following output:

```
  • Press Ctrl+C to exit
  • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console
```

Open your favorite browser and go to `http://localhost:8800` (port `8800` is opened on your node on `localhost` only--you may want to forward the port to your workstation in order to access the admin console).

The first page will ask you to upload your Gitpod license which you can get [here](/community-license) For more information about our licenses and respective pricing plans, please visit our [self-hosted pricing page](https://www.gitpod.io/self-hosted).

After uploading the license, you will be forwarded to the config page. On this page, you need to enter your domain name for your Gitpod installation. You can also configure to use [external components](./requirements) (by default internal ones are installed) as well as your TLS certs setup or your [workspace size](./configuring-workspace-resources). Click “Continue” to proceed with the installation.

![kots-install-config](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-install-config.png)

In the next step, the installer runs a preflight check. This validates your cluster meets the minimum requirements. Everything is green? Awesome! Click “Continue” to proceed.

![kots-preflights-results](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-preflights-results.png)

Now, you are seeing the installation admin page. Once the installation has been finished successfully, you will see the status “Ready” with a small green indicator next to the Gitpod logo. You will also see which version you installed and which license you are using.

![kots-admin-dashboard](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-admin-dashboard.png)

Open your Gitpod domain in your browser to access your running Gitpod instance. You should be greeted by the following screen:

![welcome screen](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/welcome-screen.png)

You will then be asked to configure a git integration:

![git integration setup](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/git-integration-setup.png)

This git integration will also serve as the way that you and your users get authenticated against your Gitpod installation. You can find out more in the [Integrations](/docs/integrations) section.

> **Important:** Public (SaaS) Source Control Management Systems (SCMs) (i.e. [GitLab.com](http://Gitlab.com), [GitHub.com](http://github.com/) and [Bitbucket.org](http://Bitbucket.org)) are **not** integrated by default with a Self-Hosted Gitpod instance because OAuth apps are tied to domains. Therefore, these public SCMs need to be integrated manually with an OAuth application you specifically create for your domain. This is done similarly to how it is done for the private/self-hosted versions of each SCM. As such their respective guides also apply here:
>
> - Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/gitlab#registering-a-self-hosted-gitlab-installation) steps to integrate [`GitLab.com`](https://gitlab.com/) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. You will need to enter `gitlab.com` as the `Provider Host Name` in the New Git Integration Modal.
> - Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/github-enterprise) steps to integrate [`GitHub.com`](http://github.com) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. You will need to enter `github.com` as the `Provider Host Name` in the New Git Integration Modal.
> - Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/bitbucket-server) steps to integrate [`Bitbucket.org`](https://bitbucket.org/) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. Select `Bitbucket` as the `Provider Type` in the New Git Integration Modal. For bitbucket.org this requires configuring an "OAuth consumer" on a "workspace". This is slightly different from the documented Bitbucket Server integration. See [gitpod PR #9894](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/9894#pullrequestreview-969013833) for an example.

> **Note:** Your first workspace start can take a bit of time because the workspace image first needs to be built and then downloaded. Subsequent workspace starts should be much quicker.

Once you are all set up, you can visit the [getting started with Gitpod page](/docs/introduction/getting-started) to start learning about using Gitpod. You should also familiarise yourself with our [guides around operating Gitpod Self-Hosted](./operational-guides), especially the guide that explains [how to update Gitpod](./updating).

The Local Preview of Gitpod Self-Hosted is the easiest way to try out Gitpod locally in situations where you cannot use the SaaS version ([gitpod.io](/docs/introduction/getting-started)) and cannot easily spin up a Kubernetes cluster to use the [Proof-of-Value Reference Architecture](./reference-architecture/proof-of-value). It allows you to try Gitpod Self-Hosted locally with minimal effort and resource requirements. As a result, this is **not intended for production** nor continuous usage. Please refer to the [installation guide](./installing-gitpod) for instructions on how to install Gitpod for continuous usage. <!-- To Do : replace link to getting started with reference architectures once these are fully ready-->

This install method runs a [K3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster inside a Docker container. Self-signed certificates are automatically created and a Gitpod instance using these certificates will be installed into the `k3s` cluster. See our [TLS](./advanced/tls) page for more information about Gitpod and certificates.

## 1. Running the Docker container

Run the following command to get the `local-preview` Docker container up and running:

```bash
docker run -p 443:443 --privileged --name gitpod -it --mount type=volume,source=gitpod,destination=/var/gitpod eu.gcr.io/gitpod-core-dev/build/local-preview
```

Unpacking the above command:

- `-p 443:443` to map the `443` container port to host.
- `--privileged` to be able to run docker (and hence `k3s`) inside the container. This is necessary.
- `--name gitpod` to set the name of the docker container for further access.
- `--rm` to delete the Docker container after stopping.
- `--mount type=volume,source=gitpod,destination=/var/gitpod` to create a volume called `gitpod`, and mounting it to the container.

> **Note:** By default, `preview.gitpod-self-hosted.com` is the DOMAIN to access Gitpod which routes to `127.0.0.1` localhost IP address. To use another host network IP Address, the `DOMAIN` environment can be set accordingly via an `-e` flag in the above command. This is useful to share access to the Gitpod Self-Hosted instance running on your machine within your local network. For Example, `192.168.0.42` Host Network IP would be `192-168-0-42.nip.io`, set by appending `-e DOMAIN=192-168-0-42.nip.io`.

## 2. Accessing Gitpod

> **Note:** It usually takes around 5 minutes to go from the `starting Gitpod` status to `Gitpod is running`. Among other things, this will depend on the speed of your internet connection. Once Gitpod is ready, it will look as follows:

![gitpod is ready](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/local-preview-ready.png)

As this is a self-signed instance of Gitpod, the Gitpod root CA cert has to be imported into your browser manually to access the full functionality of Gitpod. The certificate can be retrieved by running the following:

```bash
docker cp gitpod:/var/gitpod/gitpod-ca.crt $HOME/gitpod-ca.crt
```

This certificate is saved at `$HOME/gitpod-ca.crt` and can then be loaded into your browser. Most browsers also require a restart before they can start to use the imported certificate. For instructions on how to load the certificate, choose your setup below:

Once the certificate is loaded and Gitpod is ready, the URL to access the Gitpod instance would be `https://preview.gitpod-self-hosted.com` unless the `DOMAIN` environment is overridden in which case the same has to be used.

You should be greeted by the following screen:

![welcome screen](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/welcome-screen.png)

You will then be asked to configure a git integration:

![git integration setup](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/git-integration-setup.png)

This git integration will also serve as the way that you and your users get authenticated against your Gitpod installation. You can find out more in the [Integrations](/docs/integrations) section.

> **Important:** Public (SaaS) Source Control Management Systems (SCMs) (i.e. [GitLab.com](http://Gitlab.com), [GitHub.com](http://github.com/) and [Bitbucket.org](http://Bitbucket.org)) are **not** integrated by default with a Self-Hosted Gitpod instance because OAuth apps are tied to domains. Therefore, these public SCMs need to be integrated manually with an OAuth application you specifically create for your domain. This is done similarly to how it is done for the private/self-hosted versions of each SCM. As such their respective guides also apply here:
>
> - Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/gitlab#registering-a-self-hosted-gitlab-installation) steps to integrate [`GitLab.com`](https://gitlab.com/) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. You will need to enter `gitlab.com` as the `Provider Host Name` in the New Git Integration Modal.
> - Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/github-enterprise) steps to integrate [`GitHub.com`](http://github.com) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. You will need to enter `github.com` as the `Provider Host Name` in the New Git Integration Modal.
> - Follow [these](/docs/configure/authentication/bitbucket-server) steps to integrate [`Bitbucket.org`](https://bitbucket.org/) with your self-hosted Gitpod instance. Select `Bitbucket` as the `Provider Type` in the New Git Integration Modal. For bitbucket.org this requires configuring an "OAuth consumer" on a "workspace". This is slightly different from the documented Bitbucket Server integration. See [gitpod PR #9894](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/9894#pullrequestreview-969013833) for an example.

> **Note:** Your first workspace start can take a bit of time because the workspace image first needs to be built and then downloaded. Subsequent workspace starts should be much quicker.

Once you are all set up, you can visit the [getting started with Gitpod page](/docs/introduction/getting-started) to start learning about using Gitpod.

Sometimes nodes become unhealthy, or you need to prevent the autoscaler from removing the node from your cluster.

## Avoiding Node Scale-down

If you wish to cordon a node with terminating workspaces, or, keep a node so you have time to manually backup user data:

```shell
# reference: https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-prevent-cluster-autoscaler-from-scaling-down-a-particular-node
$ kubectl annotate node <nodename> cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/scale-down-disabled=true
```

## Handling Unhealthy Nodes

Prevent new workspaces from being scheduled to a node if they become unhealthy:

```shell
$ kubectl cordon <nodename>
```

# Monitoring

Once you have Gitpod self-hosted up and running, the next step is making sure it _continues_ to run as expected. This guide shows you how to set up a monitoring solution that consumes the data that Gitpod produces in order to help you understand the overall state of your Gitpod installation.

> **Note** All metrics shown on this page are experimental and might change in the future.

## Metrics collection

Several components of Gitpod expose metrics using the [Prometheus exposition format](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/), but for this guide, we'll focus on the most important one that makes sure that Workspaces are starting and running reasonably.

Gitpod is all about Workspaces, so the information that you want to keep an eye on is:

- How many workspaces are currently running.
- Workspaces are starting.
- Workspaces are starting in a reasonable time frame.
- Running workspaces don't stop unexpectedly.

`ws-manager` is the component responsible for measuring and exposing such data, so you want to make sure that your Prometheus instance is scraping metrics from this specific component. Metrics are exposed through port `9500`, at the `/metrics` endpoint.

We recommend using the [Prometheus-Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) and the [ServiceMonitor](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#servicemonitorspec) or [PodMonitor](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#podmonitorspec) CRDs to simplify the configuration surface.

## Dashboards and Alerts

To have all useful data available and presented in a friendly way, it is recommend building [Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) with the most important metrics (the ones shown in this guide). If you prefer, you can [import](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/#import-dashboard) [one of our examples](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/operations/observability/mixins/self-hosted/dashboards/examples/overview.json) as a baseline to your own dashboards.

Alerting can be done with [Prometheus itself](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/). If you are using the Prometheus-Operator as we recommended, you can also use the [PrometheusRule](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#prometheusrulespec) CRD to simplify alerting configuration. The [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#alertmanagerspec) CRD can be used to configure alert routing to different popular platform such as [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) or [Slack](https://slack.com/).

## What you should keep an eye on

### How many workspaces are currently running

To discover how many workspaces are currently running, use the [PromQL query](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) below:

```promql
sum(gitpod_ws_manager_workspace_phase_total{phase="RUNNING"}) by (type)
```

`gitpod_ws_manager_workspace_phase_total` is a [Gauge](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge). Although not suitable for alerting (because the amount of workspaces say little about your installation's health), with this query, you're able to tell how many workspaces, prebuilds and imagebuilds are running. This can be good information to tell how saturated your Gitpod instance is.

### Workspaces are starting

The metric for this one is very similar to the one mentioned above, we're just changing the phase to `PENDING` instead of `RUNNING`.

```promql
sum(gitpod_ws_manager_workspace_phase_total{phase="PENDING"}) by (type)
```

This metric is a good candidate for alerting. If this number is steadily going up, it means that Workspaces are having a hard time getting to the `RUNNING` state, which is a good indicator of bad user experience. A good threshold changes from organization to organization, it is recommended to periodically review this alert's threshold as the usage of Gitpod increases or decreases.

### Workspaces are starting in a reasonable time frame

To ensure a good user experience, you'll also want to make sure that Workspaces are starting swiftly! [Histograms](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) are used to capture this information. With histograms, it's possible to measure different percentiles and capture a high-level overview and outliers at the same time.

Example queries are shown below:

```promql
# 95th percentile
histogram_quantile(0.95,
    sum(rate(gitpod_ws_manager_workspace_startup_seconds_bucket{type="REGULAR"}[5m])) by (le)
)

# 50th percentile
histogram_quantile(0.5,
    sum(rate(gitpod_ws_manager_workspace_startup_seconds_bucket{type="REGULAR"}[5m])) by (le)
)
```

Sluggishness, depending on how bad it is, can be even worst than a fast failure. For that reason, alerting on workspaces taking too long to start is a good idea. It is suggested to collect feedback from users of your Gitpod installation to decide the correct thresholds for the alert on this metric.

### Running workspaces don't stop unexpectedly

Last but not less important, you want to make sure that running workspaces do not fail and stop abruptly. `ws-manager` exposes a [counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter) that counts all workspace failures, making it possible to measure workspace failure rate (i.e. how many workspaces are failing per second).

The query is shown below:

```promql
sum(rate(gitpod_ws_manager_workspace_stops_total{reason="failed"}[5m])) by (type)
```

The goal is that this metric stays as close to 0 as possible. If it starts to increase it means something is going wrong! Alerting can be set for high error rates, but just like the ones above the threshold will come from experience operating Gitpod. It is suggested to periodically review the threshold as your installation increases or decreases usage.

It may be necessary for you to prevent users from starting Gitpod workspaces (in a `<namespace>`). Please see the [update guide](./updating) for more information.

> It is required to prevent workspace starts when updating Gitpod and using the [Single Cluster Reference Architecture](../latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) because it is not highly-available.

This can be done with `kubectl`, after which, users won't be able to start workspaces until the `ws-manager` pod is running again.

> **Caution:** You must [stop running workspaces](./stop-workspaces) and wait for them to terminate before proceeding. Failure to do so can result in user data loss, because the workspaces will not be able to reliably back-up.

To scale-down the `ws-manager` component and prevent workspace starts:

```shell
kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment/ws-manager -n <namespace>
```

After which, users will receive an error when trying to start workspaces. Once Gitpod is redeployed, this change will be reset automatically and workspaces will be allowed to start again.

The heart of this reference architecture is a **Kubernetes cluster** where all Gitpod components are deployed to. This cluster consists of three node pools:

1. **Services Node Pool**: The Gitpod “app” with all its services is deployed to these nodes. These services provide the users with the dashboard and manage the provisioning of workspaces.
2. **Regular Workspaces Node Pool**: Gitpod deploys the actual workspaces (where the actual developer work is happening) to these nodes.
3. **Headless Workspace Node Pool**: Gitpod deploys the imagebuild and prebuild workspaces (where build work generally demands more CPU and disk) to these needs.

Gitpod services, headless, and regular workspaces have vastly differing resource and isolation requirements. These workloads are separated onto different node pools to provide a better quality of service and security guarantees.

You need to assign the following labels to the node pools to enforce that the Gitpod components are scheduled to the proper node pools:

| Node Pool                    | Labels                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Services Node Pool           | `gitpod.io/workload_meta=true`,<br/>`gitpod.io/workload_ide=true`,<br/>`gitpod.io/workload_workspace_services=true` |
| Regular Workspace Node Pool  | `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_regular=true`                                                                         |
| Headless Workspace Node Pool | `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_headless=true`                                                                        |

The following table gives an overview of the node types for the different cloud providers that are used by this reference architecture.

|                              | GCP               | AWS           | Azure             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Services Node Pool           | `n2d-standard-4`  | `m6i.xlarge`  | `Standard_D4_v4`  |
| Regular Workspace Node Pool  | `n2d-standard-16` | `m6i.4xlarge` | `Standard_D16_v4` |
| Headless Workspace Node Pool | `n2d-standard-16` | `m6i.4xlarge` | `Standard_D16_v4` |

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-cluster">

<div slot="gcp">

First, we [create a **service account**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) for the cluster. The service account needs to have the following roles:

| Roles                         |
| ----------------------------- |
| roles/storage.admin           |
| roles/logging.logWriter       |
| roles/monitoring.metricWriter |
| roles/container.admin         |

Run the following commands to create the service account:

```bash
GKE_SA=gitpod-gke
GKE_SA_EMAIL="${GKE_SA}"@"${PROJECT_NAME}".iam.gserviceaccount.com
gcloud iam service-accounts create "${GKE_SA}" --display-name "${GKE_SA}"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" --member serviceAccount:"${GKE_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/storage.admin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" --member serviceAccount:"${GKE_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/logging.logWriter"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" --member serviceAccount:"${GKE_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/container.admin"
```

After that, we [create a **Kubernetes cluster**](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-regional-cluster).

Unfortunately, you cannot create a cluster without the default node pool. Since we need a custom node pool, you need to remove the default one.

    --max-nodes=50 \
    --region="${REGION}"
```

Now, you can **connect `kubectl`** to your newly created cluster.

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials --region="${REGION}" "${CLUSTER_NAME}"
```

After that, you need to create cluster role bindings to allow the current user to create new RBAC rules.

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
    --user="$(gcloud config get-value core/account)"
```

<div slot="aws">

> **Note:** By default, when Gitpod is being installed using the instructions here, EKS will create a classic load balancer that you can point your DNS entries at. If you are unable to use a AWS Classic Load Balancer (e.g. because you use SSL certificates generated by AWS), please follow [the Setting up your EKS cluster with dual ALB + NLB load balancers guide](../advanced/eks-with-alb-and-nlb) _alongside_ this reference architecture guide.

For `eksctl`, configuring the cluster and the node groups cannot happen simultaneously. You need to deploy the cluster control plane first, do modifications to the network stack (Calico), and then provision the node groups. This ensures you have the maximum number of pods available (110 in most cases) to run Gitpod workspaces.

The example `eksctl` config file includes services accounts that might not be relevant to a particular deployment, but are included for reference.

- `cert-manager` provided for the required cert-manager tooling. If using DNS-01 challenges for Let's Encrypt with a Route53 zone, then enable the cert-manager `wellKnownPolicies` or ensure one exists with permissions to modify records in the zone
- `aws-load-balancer-controller` enables ELB creation for LoadBalancer services and integration with AWS Application Load Balancers
- `cluster-autoscaler` connects to the AWS autoscaler
- `ebs-csi-controller-sa` enables provisioning of the EBS volumes for PVC storage

Provided below is a complete `eksctl` configuration file that will deploy all the components required for an EKS installation to support Gitpod. All references to a `gitpod-cluster.yaml` file refer to this reference.

`eksctl` will be configuring the VPC and networking along with creating the EKS cluster itself, if you need to use pre-existing networking provisioned by another team or department, refer to the [custom VPC documentation](https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-networking/#use-existing-vpc-other-custom-configuration).

<details>
  <summary  class="text-p-medium">Note on AMI Usage</summary>

In this reference example, the Ubuntu2004 AMI family is used instead of listing a specific AMI ID. This simplifies portability and allows for the use of the built-in bootstrap command instead of having to create a custom one. If you want to do more customization of your bootstrap command or use a static AMI, first, replace `amiFamily: Ubuntu2004` with `ami: ami-customid` where `ami-customid` is from Ubuntu's EKS AMI list or the output from the below command. You will then replace `preBootstrapCommands` with your bootstrap script under a new section labeled `overrideBootstrapCommand`.

```bash
aws ec2 describe-images --owners 099720109477 \
    --filters 'Name=name,Values=ubuntu-eks/k8s_1.22/images/*' \
    --query 'sort_by(Images,&CreationDate)[-1].ImageId' \
    --executable-users all \
    --output text --region us-west-2
```

Refer to `eksctl`'s documentation on [AMI Family](https://eksctl.io/usage/custom-ami-support/) for more information on its behavior.

To ensure there are enough IPs and networking policy enforcement is in place, this reference architecture uses Calico for networking. To enable Calico in an EKS installation it must be done after the control plane has been provisioned and before the nodegroups have been created.

First: Run `eksctl` with the `--without-nodegroup` flag to provision just the control plane defined in the `gitpod-cluster.yaml`:

```bash
eksctl create cluster --without-nodegroup --config-file gitpod-cluster.yaml
```

This should result in the following output:

```

After this command finishes, check that `eksctl` also created the kubeconfig properly by running the command `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`. If deployed correctly one should see the list of pods in a pending state.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

This should result in:

```bash
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coredns-5947f47f5f-69lvv   0/1     Pending   0          26m
coredns-5947f47f5f-srm5t   0/1     Pending   0          26m
```

### Calico Installation

This is following the instructions provided by [Tigera](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/getting-started/kubernetes/managed-public-cloud/eks).

To install Calico, first remove the default AWS-provided networking component:

```bash
kubectl delete daemonset -n kube-system aws-node
```

Install the Calico manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/manifests/calico-vxlan.yaml
```

Now configure Calico for EKS-specific support with the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system set env daemonset/calico-node FELIX_AWSSRCDSTCHECK=Disable
```

### Additional Network configuration

To use RDS in the VPC you will need security groups created and associated with the Services nodegroup before it is launched. RDS does not have to be deployed yet but an additional security group for the Services nodegroup needs to be created and added to your `gitpod-cluster.yaml` before continuing.

Get the ID of the cluster `eksctl` just created. If you kept the tag `project=gitpod` in the `gitpod-cluster.yaml` file, retrieve the id and cidr block with:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=tag:project,Values=gitpod" --query 'Vpcs[*].[VpcId, CidrBlock]'
```

This should result in:

```bash
[
    [
        "<VPC ID similar to: vpc-09a109f23dad0a298>",
        "192.168.0.0/16"
    ]
]
```

Create the new security group (we do not need to have rules added to it yet) using the vpc-id from above, note how tags are auto-populated to the security group as well:

```bash
aws ec2 create-security-group --description 'Gitpod Services Nodegroup' --group-name 'gitpod-services' \
--vpc-id <!add VPC ID from above here!> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=security-group,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=gitpod-services-sg},{Key=project,Value=gitpod},{Key=department,Value=demo}]'
```

This should return something similar to:

```bash
{
    "GroupId": "<GroupID, similar to: sg-04b9a5f403307efe5>",
    "Tags": [
        {
            "Key": "project",
            "Value": "gitpod"
        },
        {
            "Key": "department",
            "Value": "demo"
        }
    ]
}
```

Update your `gitpod-cluster.yaml` to add the `GroupId` from the previous command to the `securityGroups.attachIDs` list in the `services` `managedNodeGroups`:

```yaml
securityGroups:
  attachIDs: ["<Add your GroupId here, similar to: sg-04b9a5f403307efe5"]
```

Store the `GroupID` for easier reuse when creating the RDS instance later in this guide:

```bash
export SERVICES_SECURITYGROUP_ID="<add GroupID from above here, similar to: sg-04b9a5f403307efe5>"
```

If you destroy this cluster and recreate it, you will need to redo the above step as the old security group would have been deleted along with the VPC.

### SSH Access to nodegroups

`eksctl` allows for [ssh keys](https://eksctl.io/usage/schema/#managedNodeGroups-ssh) to be added to your nodegroups for troubleshooting. By default, the `gitpod-cluster.yaml` does not configure this. AWS Systems Manager is enabled by default, allowing for connectivity [through multiple methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html) to each instance in your nodegroup.

### Create nodegroups

To ensure that if there are problems deploying the services nodegroup (you provided an incorrect security group ID for example) it can be deleted easily and not require having to delete a partially deployed workspaces nodegroup, create it before the workspaces nodegroup.

Create the services nodegroups with `eksctl create nodegroup --include=services --config-file gitpod-cluster.yaml`:

```bash
eksctl create nodegroup --include=services --config-file gitpod-cluster.yaml
```

This should result in:

```bash
2022-06-24 13:42:01 [ℹ]  nodegroup "services" will use "ami-0793b4124359a6ad7" [Ubuntu2004/1.22]

```

Create the workspaces nodegroups second if the services are deployed correctly.

```bash
eksctl create nodegroup --include=regular-workspaces,headless-workspaces --config-file gitpod-cluster.yaml
```

```bash
2022-06-24 13:55:08 [ℹ]  nodegroup "services" will use "ami-0793b4124359a6ad7" [Ubuntu2004/1.22]

2022-06-24 13:59:13 [ℹ]  all nodegroups have up-to-date cloudformation templates
```

You can verify that your installation was deployed properly with the custom `kubectl` command provided below which will let you review maxpods, kernel and containerd versions to ensure they are meeting [our minimum requirements](../../latest/requirements) as intended.

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o=custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,\
NODEGROUP:.metadata.labels.eks\.amazonaws\.com/nodegroup,\
RUNTIME:.status.nodeInfo.containerRuntimeVersion,\
MAXPODS:.status.capacity.pods,\
KERNEL:.status.nodeInfo.kernelVersion,\
AMIFAMILY:.status.nodeInfo.osImage,\
K8S:.status.nodeInfo.kubeletVersion,\
Instance-ID:.spec.providerID"
```

Because of how EKS launches instances, coredns may end up running on a single node, which is against best practices. Before continuing to the next steps, restart coredns to ensure it is running on two nodes.

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment.apps/coredns -n kube-system
```

### Enable cluster autoscaling

Gitpod's resource usage will vary depending on the number of active workspaces and image prebuilds during the day. The use of a cluster autoscaler is recommended to scale EKS nodes on demand and thus minimize the cost you pay.

```bash
CLUSTER_NAME="gitpod"
AWS_REGION="eu-west-1"

helm repo add autoscaler https://kubernetes.github.io/autoscaler
helm repo update
helm upgrade \
    --atomic \
    --cleanup-on-fail \
    --install \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --reset-values \
    --wait \
    --set cloudProvider=aws \
    --set awsRegion=$AWS_REGION \
    --set autoDiscovery.clusterName=$CLUSTER_NAME \
    --set rbac.serviceAccount.create=false \
    --set rbac.serviceAccount.name=cluster-autoscaler \
    --set securityContext.fsGroup=65534 \
    --set extraArgs.skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false \
    --set extraArgs.skip-nodes-with-system-pods=false \
    --set extraArgs.expander=least-waste \
    --set extraArgs.balance-similar-node-groups=true \
    --set extraArgs.scale-down-utilization-threshold=0.2 \
    --set extraArgs.v=2 \
    autoscaler autoscaler/cluster-autoscaler
```

### Deleting the cluster

In the future to delete this cluster any additional resources added to the VPC will need to be deleted before deleting the cluster, otherwise, cloudformations will fail to delete the VPC and complete deleting the cluster. The alternative is to create a VPC managed separately and install EKS using the additions for working [with existing VPCs](https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-networking/#use-existing-vpc-other-custom-configuration) in `eksctl`.

The order resources to delete if created:

- RDS First
- RDS security group
- Services Nodegroup
- Services security group
- eksctl delete cluster

Full removal of these installed components would look something like this (commands are grouped for brevity):

```bash
#### delete RDS resources
aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier gitpod-instance --skip-final-snapshot --delete-automated-backups
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id sg-0e538ccac25bb1387
aws rds delete-db-subnet-group --db-subnet-group-name gitpod-rds

#### delete the services node group
eksctl delete nodegroup --name services --cluster gitpod --disable-eviction --parallel 4 --max-grace-period 0s --wait

#### delete the security group added for rds
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id sg-04b9a5f403307efe5
eksctl delete cluster --name gitpod --force --disable-nodegroup-eviction --wait

#### The following removal steps are optional; if you plan on creating another Gitpod installation then the S3 bucket,
#### access account, key, and policy can be kept for later use.

#### delete s3 resources
aws s3 rm s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME} --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME} --force

#### delete iam resources
aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name gitpod-s3-access --policy-arn 'arn:aws:iam::12344:policy/gitpod_s3_access_policy'

# delete access keys:
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name gitpod-s3-access
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name gitpod-s3-access --access-key-id AKI---------
aws iam delete-user --user-name gitpod-s3-access

# ensure that nothing else is attached to this policy
aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn 'arn:aws:iam::12344:policy/gitpod_s3_access_policy'
aws iam delete-policy --policy-arn 'arn:aws:iam::12344:policy/gitpod_s3_access_policy'
```

This section will create a Kubernetes cluster based on the latest supported version of AKS, create node pools for Gitpod services, regular workspaces, and headless workspaces, and will fetch cluster credentials.

First, determine the latest version of AKS suitable for Gitpod.

> Gitpod supports Kubernetes 1.21 or later, but using the latest supported version of AKS is recommended.

```bash
AKS_VERSION=$(az aks get-versions \
    --location $LOCATION \
    --query "orchestrators[?contains(orchestratorVersion, '1.24.')].orchestratorVersion | [-1]" -o tsv)
```

Create the AKS cluster and a default node pool. Gitpod services and other supporting components will run on this node pool.

```bash
az aks create \
    --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
    --nodepool-name "services" \
    --location "${LOCATION}" \
    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
    --kubernetes-version "${AKS_VERSION}" \
    --network-plugin kubenet \
    --network-policy calico \
    --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
    --enable-managed-identity \
    --min-count "1" \
    --max-count "4" \
    --max-pods "110" \
    --node-osdisk-size "100" \
    --node-vm-size "Standard_D4_v4" \
    --nodepool-labels \
        gitpod.io/workload_meta=true \
        gitpod.io/workload_ide=true \
        gitpod.io/workload_workspace_services=true \
    --no-ssh-key \
    --vm-set-type "VirtualMachineScaleSets"
```

Create a node pool for regular workspaces.

```bash
az aks nodepool add \
    --name "regularws" \
    --cluster-name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
    --kubernetes-version "${AKS_VERSION}" \
    --labels gitpod.io/workload_workspace_regular=true \
    --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
    --min-count "1" \
    --max-count "50" \
    --max-pods "110" \
    --node-osdisk-size "512" \
    --node-vm-size "Standard_D16_v4"
```

Create a node pool for headless workspaces.

```bash
az aks nodepool add \
    --name "headlessws" \
    --cluster-name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
    --kubernetes-version "${AKS_VERSION}" \
    --labels gitpod.io/workload_workspace_headless=true \
    --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
    --node-count "1" \
    --min-count "1" \
    --max-count "50" \
    --max-pods "110" \
    --node-osdisk-size "512" \
    --node-vm-size "Standard_D16_v4"
```

After the cluster and node pools have been created, fetch the AKS credentials. These credentials will be used to install external-dns, cert-manager, and install Gitpod itself.

```bash
az aks get-credentials \
    --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
    --overwrite-existing
```

Gitpod uses a **relational database management system** to store structural data. Gitpod supports MySQL. The database is a central component in Gitpod where all metadata about users and workspaces as well as settings of the Gitpod instance (such as auth providers) are stored. That makes the database a critical component. In case of a database outage, you will not be able to log in, use the Gitpod dashboard, or start workspaces.

In this reference architecture, we use managed MYSQL databases provided by cloud providers.

> Gitpod requires your database instance to have a database named `gitpod` in it.

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-database">
<div slot="gcp">

As a relational database, we create a [Google Cloud SQL instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql) with MySQL 5.7. Use the following commands to create the database instance:

```bash
MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME=gitpod-mysql
gcloud sql instances create "${MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME}" \
    --database-version=MYSQL_5_7 \
    --storage-size=20 \
    --storage-auto-increase \
    --tier=db-n1-standard-2 \
    --region="${REGION}" \
    --replica-type=FAILOVER \
    --enable-bin-log

gcloud sql instances patch "${MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME}" --database-flags \
            explicit_defaults_for_timestamp=off
```

After that, we create the database named `gitpod` as well as a dedicated Gitpod database user with a random password.

```bash
gcloud sql databases create gitpod --instance="${MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME}"

MYSQL_GITPOD_USERNAME=gitpod
MYSQL_GITPOD_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 20)
gcloud sql users create "${MYSQL_GITPOD_USERNAME}" \
    --instance="${MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME}" \
    --password="${MYSQL_GITPOD_PASSWORD}"
```

Finally, you need to create a service account that has the `roles/cloudsql.client` role:

```bash
MYSQL_SA=gitpod-mysql
MYSQL_SA_EMAIL="${MYSQL_SA}"@"${PROJECT_NAME}".iam.gserviceaccount.com
gcloud iam service-accounts create "${MYSQL_SA}" --display-name "${MYSQL_SA}"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" \
    --member serviceAccount:"${MYSQL_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/cloudsql.client"
```

Save the service account key to the file `./mysql-credentials.json`:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create --iam-account "${MYSQL_SA_EMAIL}" \
    ./mysql-credentials.json
```

</div>
<div slot="aws">

We will create an RDS MySQL `db.m5g.large` instance running MySQL 5.7. Before deploying an RDS instance, additional configuration has to be done to the VPC created by the `eksctl` command:

### Create an RDS security group

First, find the subnet IDs for the public subnets in your environment. For deploying RDS in private subnets replace true with false in the below command:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-subnets \
    --filters "Name=tag:project,Values=gitpod" \
    --query 'Subnets[?MapPublicIpOnLaunch==`true`] | [*].[SubnetId, AvailabilityZone, CidrBlock, MapPublicIpOnLaunch]'
```

This should give you an output similar to the following:

```bash
[
    [
        "<SubnetID, similar to: subnet-0686443f3f2782453>",
        "eu-west-1a",
        "192.168.64.0/19",
        true
    ],
    [
        "<SubnetID, similar to: subnet-010ea25d0e398f6df>",
        "eu-west-1c",
        "192.168.0.0/19",
        true
    ],
    [
        "<SubnetID, similar to: subnet-0f0370a5697d85df2>",
        "eu-west-1b",
        "192.168.32.0/19",
        true
    ]
]
```

Using the three subnet IDs, create an RDS subnet group, with the name `gitpod-rds`:

```bash
aws rds create-db-subnet-group \
    --db-subnet-group-name gitpod-rds \
    --db-subnet-group-description "Subnet for the Gitpod RDS deployment in VPC" \
    --subnet-ids '[ "<SubnetID 1 from above, similar to: subnet-0686443f3f2782453>", "SubnetID 2 from above, similar to: subnet-010ea25d0e398f6df>", "SubnetID 3 from above, similar to: subnet-0f0370a5697d85df2>" ]' \
    --tags Key=project,Value=gitpod
```

Now you will need to create a security group for the RDS instance, running a similar command as before. Note you can get your vpc-id via:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=tag:project,Values=gitpod" --query 'Vpcs[*].[VpcId, CidrBlock]'
```

Create the security group for the RDS instance:

```bash
aws ec2 create-security-group --description 'Gitpod RDS' --group-name 'gitpod-rds' \
    --vpc-id <your VPC ID, similar to: vpc-09a109f23dad0a298> \
    --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=security-group,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=gitpod-rds-sg},{Key=project,Value=gitpod},{Key=department,Value=demo}]'
```

This should return an output that is similar to:

```bash
{
    "GroupId": "<GroupID similar to: sg-0e538ccac25bb1387>",
    "Tags": [
        {
            "Key": "project",
            "Value": "gitpod"
        },
        {
            "Key": "department",
            "Value": "demo"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can now update the ingress policy for the RDS group to allow for incoming connections from the Services nodegroup on port 3306, the MySQL port. This uses the services security group ID stored in an environment variable in the cluster section above:

```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id <RDS securitygroup ID from above> \
    --protocol tcp --port 3306 \
    --source-group ${SERVICES_SECURITYGROUP_ID}\
    --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=security-group-rule,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=rds-access},{Key=project,Value=gitpod},{Key=department,Value=demo}]'
```

Now you can create a password to use for MySQL. This will be required for the creation of the RDS instance and later for use by the Gitpod installer:

```bash
export MYSQL_GITPOD_PW=$(openssl rand -hex 18)
echo $MYSQL_GITPOD_PW
```

Now you can create the [Multi-AZ RDS instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZSingleStandby.html) using the MySQL password, the security group, and RDS subnet you created in the previous steps:

```bash
aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-name gitpod \
    --db-instance-identifier gitpod-instance \
    --db-instance-class db.m5.large \
    --db-subnet-group-name gitpod-rds \
    --vpc-security-group-ids sg-0e538ccac25bb1387 \
    --multi-az \
    --engine mysql \
    --allocated-storage 20 \
    --max-allocated-storage 120 \
    --master-username gitpod \
    --master-user-password $MYSQL_GITPOD_PW \
    --engine-version 5.7 \
    --tags Key=project,Value=gitpod Key=Name,Value=Gitpod-MySQLDB,Key=department,Value=demo
```

This should return an output similar to the following:

```bash
{
    "DBInstance": {
        "DBInstanceIdentifier": "gitpod-instance",
        "DBInstanceClass": "db.m5.large",
        "Engine": "mysql",
        "DBInstanceStatus": "creating",
        "MasterUsername": "gitpod",
        "DBName": "gitpod",
        "AllocatedStorage": 20,
        "PreferredBackupWindow": "22:11-22:41",
        "BackupRetentionPeriod": 1,
        "DBSecurityGroups": [],
        "VpcSecurityGroups": [
[...]
```

To check whether instance creation has compeleted, and to retrieve the URL to use, run this command:

```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances \
    --db-instance-identifier gitpod-instance \
    --query 'DBInstances[0].[DBInstanceStatus,Endpoint.Address]'
```

Returning:

```bash
[
    "modifying",
    "<instance endpoint, similar to: gitpod-instance.coynfywwqpjg.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com>"
]
```

Store the MySQL instance endpoint for later use in the Gitpod installer:

```bash
export MYSQL_RDS_ENDPOINT="$(aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier gitpod-instance --query 'DBInstances[0].Endpoint.Address' --output text)"
```

</div>

<div slot="azure">

This section will create an Azure MySQL server instance and database for Gitpod. This external database is required to run a Gitpod cluster for production purposes. Using a dedicated MySQL instance for Gitpod is recommended but a pre-existing MySQL instance may be used if it can host databases named `gitpod` and `gitpod-sessions`.

First, set a MySQL server name. Azure MySQL server names must be universally unique; we recommend using a random value to avoid conflicts. Note this value for later use.

```bash
export MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME="gitpod$(openssl rand -hex 4)"
echo "$MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME"
```

Set the gitpod MySQL username and password. The username of `gitpod` is recommended but is not required.

```bash
export MYSQL_GITPOD_USERNAME="gitpod"
export MYSQL_GITPOD_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 20)
echo "$MYSQL_GITPOD_PASSWORD"
```

With the generated instance name and password, create the Azure MySQL server.

```bash
 az mysql server create \
    --name "${MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME}" \
    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \

    --sku-name GP_Gen5_2 \
    --ssl-enforcement Disabled \
    --storage-size 20480 \

```

After creating the MySQL server create a database called `gitpod`. When Gitpod is installed it will create an additional database called `gitpod-sessions`.

```bash
az mysql db create \
  --name gitpod \
  --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
  --server-name "${MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME}"
```

Create a MySQL firewall rule allowing access from your AKS cluster to the MySQL database.

> 💡 MySQL firewall rules with a start IP address of `0.0.0.0` and an end IP address of `0.0.0.0` restrict access to Azure resources. This is necessary to allow your Kubernetes cluster to connect to the database.
> See the [Azure MySQL firewall API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/single-server/concepts-firewall-rules#connecting-from-azure) for more information.

```bash
az mysql server firewall-rule create \
 --name "Azure_Resources" \
 --server-name "${MYSQL_INSTANCE_NAME}" \
 --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
 --start-ip-address "0.0.0.0" \
 --end-ip-address "0.0.0.0"
```

For each Gitpod installation, you need a **domain**. In this guide, we use `gitpod.example.com` as a placeholder for your domain. Gitpod also uses different subdomains for some components as well as dynamically for the running workspaces. That's why you need to configure your DNS server and your TLS certificates for your Gitpod domain with the following wildcards:

```
gitpod.example.com
*.gitpod.example.com
*.ws.gitpod.example.com
```

### Cluster ports

The entry point for all traffic is the `proxy` component which has a service of type `LoadBalancer` that allows inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) as well as port 22 (SSH access to the workspaces).

SSH access is required to work with desktop IDEs, such as [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode) and JetBrains via [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway). To enable SSH, your **load balancer** needs to be capable of working with [L4 protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Layer_4:_Transport_layer).

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-networking">
<div slot="gcp">

In this guide, we use [load balancing through a standalone network endpoint group (NEG)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/standalone-neg). For this, the Gitpod proxy service will get the following annotation by default:

```bash
cloud.google.com/neg: '{"exposed_ports": {"80":{},"443": {}}}'
```

For Gitpod, we support Calico as CNI only. You need to make sure that you DO NOT use [GKE Dataplan V2](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/dataplane-v2). That means, do not add the `--enable-dataplane-v2` flag during the cluster creation.

</div>
<div slot="aws">

It is suggested to create a dedicated VPC (and EKS instance) for Gitpod. `eksctl` can do this for you, but if VPCs have to be configured separately, follow `eksctl`’s [suggestions](https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-configuration/).

> **Note**: You can also customize `eksctl`’s [vpc](https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-subnet-settings/#custom-subnet-topology) creation to suit your existing configurations.

The VPC needs public and private subnets. All managed node groups and Gitpod services should run in the private subnet. Inbound access to the services should be through ALB/ELB services auto-provisioned by AWS based on the configuration used (standard LoadBalancer roles or creation of an Ingress). If running a jump host or VPN endpoint, it should be deployed in the public subnet.

> By default, when Gitpod is being installed, EKS will create a classic load balancer that you can point your DNS entries at. If you are unable to use a AWS Classic Load Balancer (e.g. because you use SSL certificates generated by AWS), please follow [the Setting up your EKS cluster with dual ALB + NLB load balancers guide](../advanced/eks-with-alb-and-nlb) _alongside_ this reference architecture guide.

If installing Calico, follow their [installation steps](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/getting-started/kubernetes/managed-public-cloud/eks) and ensure you modify the `hostNetwork: True` option on the cert-manager installation options later.

</div>
<div slot="azure">

Azure automatically provisions [Azure public load balancers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/load-balancer-standard) that load balance public Gitpod services and provide public Internet connectivity for Gitpod's workloads. No additional configuration is required.

</div>

</CloudPlatformToggle>

### External DNS

You also need to configure your **DNS server**. If you have your own DNS server for your domain, make sure the domain with all wildcards points to your load balancer.

Creating a dedicated DNS zone is recommended when using cert-manager or external-dns but is not required. A pre-existing DNS zone may be used as long as the **cert-manager** and/or **external-dns** services are authorized to manage DNS records within that zone. If you are providing your own TLS certificates and will manually create A records pointing to Gitpod's public load balancer IP addresses then creating a zone is unnecessary.

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-dns">
<div slot="gcp">

In this reference architecture, we use [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns) for domain name resolution. To automatically configure Cloud DNS, we use [External DNS for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns).

First, we need a **service account** with role `roles/dns.admin`. This service account is needed by cert-manager to alter the DNS settings for the DNS-01 resolution.

```bash
DNS_SA=gitpod-dns01-solver
DNS_SA_EMAIL="${DNS_SA}"@"${PROJECT_NAME}".iam.gserviceaccount.com
gcloud iam service-accounts create "${DNS_SA}" --display-name "${DNS_SA}"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" \
    --member serviceAccount:"${DNS_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/dns.admin"
```

Save the service account key to the file `./dns-credentials.json`:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create --iam-account "${DNS_SA_EMAIL}" \
    ./dns-credentials.json
```

After that, we create a [managed zone](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones).

```bash
DOMAIN=gitpod.example.com
gcloud dns managed-zones create "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
    --dns-name "${DOMAIN}." \
    --description "Automatically managed zone by kubernetes.io/external-dns"
```

Now we are ready to install External DNS. Please refer to the [External DNS GKE docs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/gke.md).

<details>
  <summary  class="text-p-medium">Example on how to install External DNS with helm</summary>

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm upgrade \
    --atomic \
    --cleanup-on-fail \
    --create-namespace \
    --install \
    --namespace external-dns \
    --reset-values \
    --set provider=google \
    --set google.project="${PROJECT_NAME}" \
    --set logFormat=json \
    --set google.serviceAccountSecretKey=dns-credentials.json \
    --wait \
    external-dns \
    bitnami/external-dns
```

</details>

Depending on what your DNS setup for your domain looks like, you most probably want to configure the nameservers for your domain. Run the following command to get a list of nameservers used by your Cloud DNS setup:

```bash
gcloud dns managed-zones describe ${CLUSTER_NAME} --format json | jq '.nameServers'
```

</div>
<div slot="aws">

If a Route53 zone has not yet been created, you can do so with the following command (replace `gitpod.example.com.` with the intended zone):

```bash
DOMAIN_NAME="gitpod.example.com"
export ROUTE53_CALLER=$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)
aws route53 create-hosted-zone \
    --name "${DOMAIN_NAME}." \
    --caller-reference $ROUTE53_CALLER \
    --hosted-zone-config Comment="gitpod-zone"
```

Once the domain has been provisioned, you can get the details with the following command and record the `Id` for later usage:

```bash
aws route53 list-hosted-zones --query "HostedZones[?Name==\`$DOMAIN_NAME.\`]"
```

Which should return something like:

```bash
[
    {
        "Id": "/hostedzone/Z1230498123094",
        "Name": "gitpod.example.com.",
        "CallerReference": "c43f5dfd-87d9-45fc-bb1f-33bf35d8244b",
        "Config": {
            "Comment": "",
            "PrivateZone": false
        },
        "ResourceRecordSetCount": 10
    }
]
```

Store this hosted zone in a variable for later use by external-dns and cert-manager:

```bash
HOSTED_ZONE_ID="$(aws route53 list-hosted-zones-by-name \
    --dns-name "$DOMAIN_NAME." \
    --query "HostedZones[0].Id" \
    --output json \
    --out text)"
```

Then install external-dns so that DNS records will be automatically created for Gitpod services. This can be ignored if you are managing DNS records yourself.

<!--
external-dns helm chart notes:

- `eksctl` is responsible for creating the external-dns Kubernetes service account and attaching
  an AWS IAM role to to the external-dns service account. The helm chart assumes that the service
  account has been pre-created (`--set serviceAccount.create=false`)
- For security purposes external-dns runs with a [UID of 65534](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/v0.12.2/Dockerfile#L35-L37)
- EKS IAM roles for service accounts expose AWS token files into the container; as external-dns
  is running as a non-root user the `fsGroup` setting must be set to change the ownership of the
  AWS token file to match the UID of the external-dns process.

With Route53 created, you can now proceed to install cert-manager. Cert-manager is needed for Gitpod's internal networking even if you are managing DNS yourself.

</div>

<div slot="azure">

This section will create an Azure managed zone, grant the AKS cluster permission to manage records in that zone, and install external-dns.

Begin by creating a new Azure managed zone. For example, if you plan on hosting Gitpod at `gitpod.svcs.example.com` then create a managed zone called `svcs.example.com`.

```bash
DOMAIN_NAME="svcs.example.com"
az network dns zone create --name $DOMAIN_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

Authorize the AKS cluster to control DNS records in the zone:

```bash
ZONE_ID=$(az network dns zone show --name "${DOMAIN_NAME}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --query "id" -o tsv)
KUBELET_OBJECT_ID=$(az aks show --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --query "identityProfile.kubeletidentity.objectId" -o tsv)

az role assignment create \
    --assignee "${KUBELET_OBJECT_ID}" \
    --role "DNS Zone Contributor" \
    --scope "${ZONE_ID}"
```

> This role assignment uses [AKS Kubelet Identity](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/azuredns/#managed-identity-using-aks-kubelet-identity)
> to authorizes the entire AKS cluster to manage DNS records in the given zone, including cert-manager and external-dns.

Look up the AKS kubelet client identity; external-dns will use this identity when authenticating to the Azure API.

```bash
KUBELET_CLIENT_ID=$(az aks show --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --query "identityProfile.kubeletidentity.clientId" -o tsv)
```

Then install the external-dns Helm chart:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm upgrade \
    --install \
    --atomic \
    --wait \
    --cleanup-on-fail \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace external-dns \
    --reset-values \
    --set provider=azure \
    --set azure.resourceGroup="${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
    --set azure.subscriptionId="${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}" \
    --set azure.tenantId="${AZURE_TENANT_ID}" \
    --set azure.useManagedIdentityExtension=true \
    --set azure.userAssignedIdentityID="${KUBELET_CLIENT_ID}" \
    --set logFormat=json \
    external-dns \
    bitnami/external-dns
```

</div>

### cert-manager

Gitpod uses TLS secure external traffic bound for Gitpod as well as identifying, authorizing, and securing internal traffic between Gitpod's internal components. While you can provide your own TLS certificate for securing external connections to Gitpod, cert-manager is required to generate internal TLS certificates.

Refer to the [cert-manager DNS01 docs](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/) for more information.

<CloudPlatformToggle>
<div slot="gcp">

Example on how to install cert-manager on GCP:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm upgrade \
    --atomic \
    --cleanup-on-fail \
    --create-namespace \
    --install \
    --namespace cert-manager \
    --reset-values \
    --set installCRDs=true \
    --set 'extraArgs={--dns01-recursive-nameservers-only=true,--dns01-recursive-nameservers=8.8.8.8:53\,1.1.1.1:53}' \
    --wait \
    cert-manager \
    jetstack/cert-manager
```

</div>
<div slot="aws">

Due to the networking behavior and service accounts in EKS, cert-manager needs a different installation procedure. First, install cert-manager with the following command:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm upgrade \
    --atomic \
    --cleanup-on-fail \
    --create-namespace \
    --install \
    --namespace cert-manager \
    --reset-values \
    --set installCRDs=true \
    --set 'extraArgs={--dns01-recursive-nameservers-only=true,--dns01-recursive-nameservers=8.8.8.8:53\,1.1.1.1:53}' \
    --set webhook.hostNetwork=true \
    --set webhook.securePort=10260 \
    --set serviceAccount.create=false \
    --set serviceAccount.name=cert-manager \
    --wait \
    cert-manager \
    jetstack/cert-manager
```

Once the installation has completed, you will need to update the cert-manager security context setting for the service account provisioned for cert-manager by `eksctl`:

```bash
kubectl patch deployment cert-manager -n cert-manager -p \
  '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"securityContext":{"fsGroup":1001,"runAsNonRoot": true}}}}}'

```

</div>

<div slot="azure">

Install cert-manager with the following command:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm upgrade \
    --install \
    --atomic \
    --wait \
    --cleanup-on-fail \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace='cert-manager' \
    --reset-values \
    --set installCRDs=true \
    --set 'extraArgs={--dns01-recursive-nameservers-only=true,--dns01-recursive-nameservers=8.8.8.8:53\,1.1.1.1:53}' \
    cert-manager \
    jetstack/cert-manager
```

</div>
</CloudPlatformToggle>

### TLS certificate

In this reference architecture, we use cert-manager to also create **TLS certificates for the Gitpod domain**. Since we need wildcard certificates for the subdomains, you must use the [DNS-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge).

Using a certificate issued by Let's Encrypt is recommended as it minimizes overhead involving TLS certificates and managing CA certificate trust, but is not required. If you already have TLS certificates for your Gitpod installation with suitable DNS names you can skip this step and use your own certificates during the installation.

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-cert-manager-tls">
<div slot="gcp">

Now, we are configuring [Google Cloud DNS for the DNS-01 challenge](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/google/). For this, we need to create a secret that contains the key for the DNS service account:

```bash
CLOUD_DNS_SECRET=clouddns-dns01-solver
kubectl create secret generic "${CLOUD_DNS_SECRET}" \
    --namespace=cert-manager \
    --from-file=key.json="./dns-credentials.json"
```

After that, we are telling cert-manager which service account it should use:

```bash
kubectl annotate serviceaccount --namespace=cert-manager cert-manager \
    --overwrite "iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=${DNS_SA_EMAIL}"
```

The next step is to create an issuer. In this guide, we create a cluster issuer. Create a file `issuer.yaml` like this:

```yaml
# Replace $LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL with your email and $PROJECT_NAME with your GCP project name
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: gitpod-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    email: $LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: issuer-account-key
    solvers:
      - dns01:
          cloudDNS:
            project: $PROJECT_NAME
```

… and run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml
```

</div>
<div slot="aws">

If using `eksctl` and the cert-manager service account along with well-known policies AND you have your intended zone hosted in Route53, then follow the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/route53/) configuration steps. An example cluster issuer using the hosted zone and cert-manager service account created by `eksctl` is below:

```yaml
# Replace $LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL with your email and $DOMAIN_NAME with your gitpod domain name (eg.`gitpod.$DOMAIN_NAME`)
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: gitpod-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: $LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt
    solvers:
      - selector:
          dnsZones:
            - $DOMAIN_NAME
        dns01:
          route53:
            region: us-east-1
```

> ⚠️ In contrast to most AWS services, Route53 does _not_ support regional endpoints. When creating your ClusterIssuer
> be careful to use the `us-east-1` region for all regions other than the Beijing and Ningxia Regions, and `cn-northwest-1`
> region for the Beijing and Ningxia regions.
>
> See the [AWS Route53 endpoints and quotas documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/r53.html) for more information.

</div>

<div slot="azure">

This section will create a cert-manager ClusterIssuer that will generate publicly trusted certificates using Let's Encrypt.

First, determine your Azure subscription ID. You can typically determine your subscription ID from your Azure CLI credentials.

```bash
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="$(az account subscription list --query '[0].subscriptionId' --output tsv)"
```

Then create a file named `issuer.yaml` containing the following content, expanding the `$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `$RESOURCE_GROUP`, and `$DOMAIN_NAME` variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: gitpod-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: issuer-account-key
    solvers:
      - dns01:
          azureDNS:
            subscriptionID: $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
            resourceGroupName: $RESOURCE_GROUP
            hostedZoneName: $DOMAIN_NAME
```

Then apply the ClusterIssuer resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml
```

> This example ClusterIssuer depends on [Azure Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to authorize requests from cert-manager to the AzureDNS API.
> Refer to the [cert-manager AzureDNS DNS01](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/azuredns/) documentation for more information on cert-manager API authorization.

![Reference Architecture Overview](../../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/reference-architecture/ReferenceArchitecture.png)

The diagram above gives an overview of the reference architecture. Starting from the user’s workstation, access is provided using a layer 4 (L4) load balancer. An internal proxy distributes this traffic within Gitpod.

The cluster-external components are accessed by a specific set of components as shown in the diagram. The external components are:

- **MySQL database**
- **Source Control Management (SCM)**, e.g. GitLab, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, BitBucket, or BitBucket Server
- **Object Storage**, e.g. Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3
- **OCI Image Registry**, e.g. Google Artifact Registry.<br/>
  _Note: This registry is used by Gitpod to cache images, and store images it builds on behalf of users. This is **not** the registry that contains the images of Gitpod’s services._

In addition, the diagram indicates the different node pools within the cluster. Notice that we separate any user workloads from Gitpod’s services (except for `ws-daemon`). In this reference architecture, we create two node pools: the services node pool (upper half in the diagram) and the workspaces node pool (lower half in the diagram).

<script lang="ts">

</script>

You need to prepare your workstation and your cloud provider (e.g. creating a project and preparing service accounts) to be able to replicate this reference architecture.

Independent of the cloud provider you are using, you need to have `kubectl` installed on your workstation and configured to access your cluster after creation.

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-preparations">

<div slot="gcp">

In order to deploy Gitpod on the [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) of the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/docs), you need to create and configure a project for your installation. In this guide, we give you examples of how to create the needed resources by using the command line tool `gcloud`. To follow these examples make sure you have [installed the `gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and [logged in to your Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login). You can also use the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) or the API instead. In that case, please refer to the linked Google docs.

First, [create a GCP project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) and [enable billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts) (you have to enable billing to enable GKE). You can freely choose a name for your project (hereinafter referred to as environment variable `PROJECT_NAME`). You also need the billing account ID (referred to as `BILLING_ACCOUNT`). To see available lDs, run [`gcloud alpha billing accounts list`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/billing/accounts/list).

```bash
PROJECT_NAME=gitpod
gcloud projects create "${PROJECT_NAME}" --set-as-default

BILLING_ACCOUNT=0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
gcloud alpha billing projects link "${PROJECT_NAME}" \
    --billing-account "${BILLING_ACCOUNT}"
```

You can verify that the proper project has been set as default with this command:

```bash
gcloud config get-value project
```

After you created your project, you need to enable the following services in this project:

| Services                         |                                                                                              |                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cloudbilling.googleapis.com      | [Google Billing API](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/reference/rest)                   | Billing is required to set up a GKE cluster.                                                 |
| containerregistry.googleapis.com | [Docker container images registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)              | Enable this service such that Gitpod can push workspace images to that repository.           |
| iam.googleapis.com               | [Identity and Access Management (IAM) API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest) | To create and use service accounts for the setup.                                            |
| compute.googleapis.com           | [Google Compute Engine API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1)         | The Google Compute Engine empowers to run virtual machines (VMs) for the Kubernetes cluster. |
| container.googleapis.com         | [Kubernetes Engine API](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest)      | The Kubernetes engine is where we will deploy Gitpod to.                                     |
| dns.googleapis.com               | [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/reference/v1)                                  | Cloud DNS is used in this reference architecture so set up the domain name resolution.       |
| sqladmin.googleapis.com          | [Cloud SQL Admin API](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api)                     | Cloud SQL for MySQL is used as database service in this reference architecture.              |

Run these commands to enable the services:

```bash
gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable dns.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
```

Now, you are prepared to create your Kubernetes cluster.

</div>

<div slot="aws">

To deploy Gitpod on [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html), you must have an Amazon account that has permissions to deploy EKS and the underlying component services, which can include:

- VPCs
- Subnets
- Internet Gateways
- EC2 Instances
- Autoscaling Groups
- Elastic Load Balancers

Specifically for Gitpod's use, you will also need permissions to create these additional components:

- Route53 DNS Zone for the intended Gitpod domain name (for use with Let's Encrypt certificate generation)
- RDS Instance running MySQL 5.7 for Gitpod's database
- S3 Bucket: Hosting Gitpod's workspace images and object storage
- AWS IAM Service account: To enable access to the S3 bucket

This guide uses the following tools:

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) for creating none EKS specific services
- [EKS CLI `eksctl`](https://eksctl.io/) for creating the EKS cluster and nodegroups themselves

Amazon has a brief run-through on how to [deploy a basic cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html) using the `eksctl` tooling if you'd like to familiarize yourself before deploying the Gitpod reference architecture.

Make sure you are logged in and are connected to the proper AWS account. Ensure AWS is configured and working with the command `aws sts get-caller-identity`. For later steps you will need to ensure that `kubectl` is [properly configured to authenticate to the newly provisioned EKS environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

**AWS Region Setting**

All commands that follow assume you have set an environment variable of `AWS_REGION` to your appropriate region or have it configured in your profile already and so will not include `--region` or `--profile` when running the `aws` command. Refer to the [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) for more information.

</div>

<div slot="azure">

To deploy Gitpod on [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes), you must have an Azure subscription and account with permission deploy AKS clusters and associated component services, including the following:

- AKS Clusters
- Virtual networks
- MySQL Databases
- Storage accounts
- Azure Container Registries
- Load balancers
- Azure DNS managed domains (and rights to assign roles on managed zones)
- Rights to make role assignments in Azure Active Directory

This guide uses the Azure CLI to create resources for your Gitpod installation and requires active Azure credentials. Credentials can be fetched by one of the following options:

- [Sign in interactively](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli#sign-in-interactively)
- [Sign in with a Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli#sign-in-with-a-service-principal) (recommended for production installations)

**Tools**

This guide uses the following tools:

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli)

If `kubectl` is not present the Azure CLI can be used to install `kubectl`:

```bash
sudo az aks install-cli
```

**Location and Resource Group**

Azure uses _resource groups_ to logically group related resources. This guide uses a dedicated resource group for the Gitpod AKS cluster and all component resources. Creating a new resource group for Gitpod resources is recommended but a pre-existing resource group may be used if necessary.

Set environment variables indicating the resource group and location where Gitpod resources will be created:

```bash
export RESOURCE_GROUP="gitpod"
export LOCATION="centralus"
```

Then create a new resource group:

```bash
az group create --location $LOCATION --name "$RESOURCE_GROUP"
```

<script lang="ts">

Kubernetes clusters pull their components from an **image registry**. In Gitpod, image registries are used for three different purposes:

1. Pulling the actual Gitpod software (components like `server`, `image-builder`, etc.).
2. Pulling base images for workspaces. This is either a default [workspace-full](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full) image or the image that is configured in the `.gitpod.yml` resp. `.gitpod.Dockerfile` in the repo.
3. Pushing individual workspace images that are built for workspaces during image start. That are for example custom images that are defined in a `.gitpod.Dockerfile` in the repo. These images are pulled by Kubernetes after image building to provision the workspace. This is the only case where Gitpod needs write access to push images.

We use a different registry for each of the three items in this reference architecture. The Gitpod images (1) are pulled from a public Google Container Registry we provide. The workspace base image (2) is pulled from Docker Hub (or from the location that is set in the Dockerfile of the corresponding repo). For the individual workspace images (3), we create an image registry that is provided by the used cloud provider. You could also configure Gitpod to use the same registry for all cases. That is particularly useful for [air-gap installations](../advanced/air-gap) where you have access to an internal image registry only.

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-registry">
<div slot="gcp">

By enabling the service `containerregistry.googleapis.com` (see above), your project provides you with an OCI Image Registry. As credentials, we need the [object storage](#object-storage) service account key that we will create below. Therefore, there is no further action needed to use the registry in Gitpod.

</div>
<div slot="aws">

ECR is currently not supported, so configuring the registry will require using an S3 bucket. You can reuse the same S3 bucket used for object storage or a separate one. The steps would be identical in creation, just use different names for both the bucket and the IAM user account.

> Please refer to the [Object Storage](./single-cluster-ref-arch#object-storage) section for instructions on how to create an S3 bucket. You can re-use the bucket created there as your registry storage backe-end.

To configure Gitpod to use the bucket created, ensure you select `In-cluster Registry`, and `S3 storage` in the installation UI. Then input the values of the bucket you've created. When setting the endpoint, please include the region such that `s3.amazonaws.com` becomes `s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`.

</div>

<div slot="azure">

This section will create an Amazon Container Registry for workspace images.

First, generate a name for the ACR instance. ACR instance names must be unique; using a random suffix is recommended but any unique registry name is sufficient.

```bash
REGISTRY_NAME="gitpod$(openssl rand -hex 4)"
```

Note the value of `$REGISTRY_NAME` for later use.

Create the container registry:

```bash
az acr create \
  --admin-enabled true \
  --location "${LOCATION}" \
  --name "${REGISTRY_NAME}" \
  --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
  --sku Premium
```

The registry server, username, and password will be needed when Gitpod is installed; note these values for later.

```bash
AZURE_REGISTRY_URL=$(az acr show \
    --name "${REGISTRY_NAME}" \
    --output tsv \
    --query loginServer \
    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}")

AZURE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=$(az acr credential show \
    --name "${REGISTRY_NAME}" \
    --output tsv \
    --query username \
    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}")

AZURE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(az acr credential show \

Gitpod uses **object storage** to store blob data. This includes workspace backups that are created when a workspace stops and are used to restore state upon restart. Different user settings like IDE preferences are also stored this way.

This reference architecture uses managed object storage commonly offered by all cloud providers.

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-object-storage">
<div slot="gcp">

For each Gitpod user, their own bucket will be created at runtime. For this reason, Gitpod needs proper rights to create buckets in the object storage. Create a service account that has the following roles:

| Roles                     |
| ------------------------- |
| roles/storage.admin       |
| roles/storage.objectAdmin |

```bash
OBJECT_STORAGE_SA=gitpod-storage
OBJECT_STORAGE_SA_EMAIL="${OBJECT_STORAGE_SA}"@"${PROJECT_NAME}".iam.gserviceaccount.com
gcloud iam service-accounts create "${OBJECT_STORAGE_SA}" --display-name "${OBJECT_STORAGE_SA}"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" \
    --member serviceAccount:"${OBJECT_STORAGE_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/storage.admin"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" \
    --member serviceAccount:"${OBJECT_STORAGE_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"
```

Save the service account key to the file `./gs-credentials.json`:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create --iam-account "${OBJECT_STORAGE_SA_EMAIL}" \
    ./gs-credentials.json
```

</div>
<div slot="aws">

Below, we create one S3 bucket and one IAM User service account to access it. These credentials and the bucket are used for both object storage and storing the workspace images via a Registry frontend deployed in Gitpod (and when Gitpod is installed). The bucket has to have a globally unique name.

```bash
export S3_BUCKET_NAME="suitably-tired-puma-registry"
echo ${S3_BUCKET_NAME}
```

### Create the S3 Bucket and ensure it is private

Create an S3 bucket using the following command:

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket ${S3_BUCKET_NAME} \
    --region eu-west-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-1 \
    --object-ownership BucketOwnerEnforced
aws s3api put-public-access-block \
    --bucket ${S3_BUCKET_NAME} \
    --public-access-block-configuration "BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true"
```

### Create an IAM user for credentials with access just to this bucket

```bash
aws iam create-user \
  --user-name gitpod-s3-access \
  --tags Key=project,Value=gitpod
```

Save the following file as `S3_policy.json`, replacing `${S3_BUCKET_NAME}` with the S3 bucket you created:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::${S3_BUCKET_NAME}>"],
      "Sid": ""
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::${S3_BUCKET_NAME}/*"],
      "Sid": ""
    }
  ],
  "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

Create the policy, taking note of the ARN in the output:

```bash
aws iam create-policy \
    --policy-name gitpod_s3_access_policy \
    --policy-document <file://S3_policy.json> \
    --tags Key=project,Value=gitpod
```

This should result in the following output:

```bash
{
    "Policy": {
        "PolicyName": "gitpod_s3_access_policy",
        "PolicyId": "ANPA2B3JAS5KQGN6MQRMW",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::691173103445:policy/gitpod_s3_access_policy",
        "Path": "/",
        "DefaultVersionId": "v1",
        "AttachmentCount": 0,
        "PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount": 0,
        "IsAttachable": true,
        "CreateDate": "2022-06-24T14:31:30+00:00",
        "UpdateDate": "2022-06-24T14:31:30+00:00",
        "Tags": [
            {
                "Key": "project",
                "Value": "gitpod"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Attach the policy to the IAM user you just created:

```bash
aws iam attach-user-policy \
    --user-name gitpod-s3-access \
    --policy-arn '<arn from above, similar to: arn:aws:iam::691173103445:policy/gitpod_s3_access_policy>'
```

### Create and store a user access token

Create an access key with the following command, and securely record the resulting `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` fields:

```bash
aws iam create-access-key --user-name gitpod-s3-access
```

This should result in an output similar to the following:

```bash
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "gitpod-s3-access",
        "AccessKeyId": "<accessKeyId>",
        "Status": "Active",
        "SecretAccessKey": "<SecretAccessKey>",
        "CreateDate": "2022-06-24T14:37:40+00:00"
    }
}
```

To test that these credentials provide write access to the S3 bucket, open a new shell session and configure it to use the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` you've just retrieved, and attempt to upload a file and then delete it:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<accessKeyId>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SecretAccessKey>
aws s3 ls s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}
echo "hello world" > gitpod_test.txt
aws s3 cp gitpod_test.txt s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}
# => upload: ./gitpod_test.txt to s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/gitpod_test.txt
aws s3 ls s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}
# => 2022-06-24 15:50:20         12 gitpod_test.txt
aws s3 rm s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}/gitpod_test.txt
# => delete: s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/gitpod_test.txt
aws s3 ls s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}
# => *nothing returns if empty*
```

To avoid impacting any further calls to AWS, unset the environment variables created:

```bash
unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

</div>

<div slot="azure">

This section will create an Azure storage account for Gitpod object storage and backups.

Generate a name for the Azure storage account. The Azure storage account name must be globally unique; using a random suffix is recommended but any unique value can be used.

```bash
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="gitpod$(openssl rand -hex 4)"
echo "$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME"
```

Note the value of `$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` for later use.

Create the storage account:

```bash
az storage account create \
  --access-tier Hot \
  --kind StorageV2 \
  --location "${LOCATION}" \
  --name "${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" \
  --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
  --sku Standard_LRS
```

After creating the storage account, grant access to Gitpod cluster to that storage account.

```bash
KUBELET_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az aks show --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --query "identityProfile.kubeletidentity.objectId" -o tsv)

STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ID=$(az storage account show \
  --name "${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" \
  --output tsv \
  --query id \
  --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}")

az role assignment create \
    --assignee "${KUBELET_PRINCIPAL_ID}" \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --scope "${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ID}"
```

Note the storage account key for later use.

```bash
STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=$(az storage account keys list \
    --account-name "${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" \
    --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \
    --query '[?keyName==`key1`].value' \
    --output tsv
)
```

Below you will find reference architectures supported and recommended by Gitpod for different situations and all major cloud providers. They help you create the infrastructure needed to run Gitpod Self-Hosted and come in the form of a guide and terraform configuration. These are used to create the infrastructure for our nightly testing and fulfil the [requirements](../latest/requirements) Gitpod has on a cluster.

> **Note:** You should see these reference architectures as a starting point for creating infrastructure that works with both Gitpod and your own infrastructure requirements and policies. However, the further you deviate from these recommended architectures, the higher the potential for Gitpod to not behave as expected.

## Overview

This reference architecture provides you with a setup where all components that are needed to operate Gitpod are deployed within the Kubernetes cluster. In contrast to a production-oriented setup, this means that the required database, object storage, well as a registry are deployed for you within the cluster. All cluster services and workspaces are deployed on a single autoscaling node group.

> If you are looking for a scalable and reliable way to run Gitpod, please take a look at our [Single Cluster Reference Architecture](./single-cluster-ref-arch).

## Cloud Provider Preparations

<Preparations />

## Kubernetes Cluster

The heart of this reference architecture is a **Kubernetes cluster** where all components are deployed to. This cluster has a single node pool that needs to have all of the following labels:

- `gitpod.io/workload_meta=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_ide=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_services=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_regular=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_headless=true`

The following table gives an overview of the node types for the different cloud providers that are used by this reference architecture.

|                  | GCP               | AWS           |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Gitpod Node Pool | `n2d-standard-16` | `m6i.4xlarge` |

<CloudPlatformToggle id="cloud-platform-toggle-cluster">

<div slot="gcp">

First, we [create a **service account**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) for the cluster. The service account needs to have the following roles:

| Roles                         |
| ----------------------------- |
| roles/logging.logWriter       |
| roles/monitoring.metricWriter |
| roles/container.admin         |

Run the following commands to create the service account:

```bash
GKE_SA=gitpod-gke
GKE_SA_EMAIL="${GKE_SA}"@"${PROJECT_NAME}".iam.gserviceaccount.com
gcloud iam service-accounts create "${GKE_SA}" --display-name "${GKE_SA}"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" --member serviceAccount:"${GKE_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/logging.logWriter"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" --member serviceAccount:"${GKE_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/monitoring.metricWriter"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NAME}" --member serviceAccount:"${GKE_SA_EMAIL}" --role="roles/container.admin"
```

After that, we [create a **Kubernetes cluster**](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-regional-cluster).

```bash
CLUSTER_NAME=gitpod
REGION=us-central1-b
GKE_VERSION=1.21.12

gcloud container clusters \
    create "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \

    --disk-size="100GB" \
    --image-type="UBUNTU_CONTAINERD" \
    --machine-type="n2d-standard-16" \
    --cluster-version="${GKE_VERSION}" \
    --zone="${ZONE}" \
    --service-account "${GKE_SA_EMAIL}" \
    --num-nodes=1 \
    --no-enable-basic-auth \
    --enable-autoscaling \
    --enable-autorepair \
    --no-enable-autoupgrade \
    --enable-ip-alias \
    --enable-network-policy \
    --create-subnetwork name="gitpod-${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
    --metadata=disable-legacy-endpoints=true \
    --scopes="gke-default,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ndev.clouddns.readwrite" \
    --node-labels="gitpod.io/workload_meta=true,gitpod.io/workload_ide=true,gitpod.io/workload_workspace_services=true,gitpod.io/workload_workspace_regular=true,gitpod.io/workload_workspace_headless=true" \
    --min-nodes=1 \
    --max-nodes=50 \
    --addons=HorizontalPodAutoscaling,NodeLocalDNS,NetworkPolicy
```

Now, you can **connect `kubectl`** to your newly created cluster.

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials --zone="${ZONE}" "${CLUSTER_NAME}"
```

After that, you need to create cluster role bindings to allow the current user to create new RBAC rules.

```bash
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
    --user="$(gcloud config get-value core/account)"
```

For `eksctl`, configuring the cluster and the node groups cannot happen simultaneously. You need to deploy the cluster control plane first, do modifications to the network stack (Calico), and then provision the node groups. This ensures you have the maximum number of pods available (110 in most cases) to run Gitpod workspaces.

The example `eksctl` config file includes services accounts that might not be relevant to a particular deployment, but are included for reference.

- `cert-manager` provided for the required cert-manager tooling. If using DNS-01 challenges for Let's Encrypt with a Route53 zone, then enable the cert-manager `wellKnownPolicies` or ensure one exists with permissions to modify records in the zone
- `aws-load-balancer-controller` enables ELB creation for LoadBalancer services and integration with AWS Application Load Balancers
- `cluster-autoscaler` connects to the AWS autoscaler
- `ebs-csi-controller-sa` enables provisioning of the EBS volumes for PVC storage
- `external-dns` creates DNS records for external-facing Gitpod services

Provided below is a complete `eksctl` configuration file that will deploy all the components required for an EKS installation to support Gitpod. All references to a `gitpod-cluster.yaml` file refer to this reference.

```

To ensure there are enough IPs and networking policy enforcement is in place, this proof of value reference architecture uses Calico for networking. To enable Calico in an EKS installation it must be done after the control plane has been provisioned and before the nodegroups have been created.

First: Run `eksctl` with the `--without-nodegroup` flag to provision just the control plane defined in the `gitpod-cluster.yaml`:

```bash
eksctl create cluster --without-nodegroup --config-file gitpod-cluster.yaml
```

This should result in the following output:

```
2022-08-11 22:10:23 [ℹ]  eksctl version 0.107.0
2022-08-11 22:10:23 [ℹ]  using region eu-west-1
2022-08-11 22:10:23 [ℹ]  setting availability zones to [eu-west-1b eu-west-1a eu-west-1c]

[...]
2022-08-11 22:27:06 [✔]  EKS cluster "gitpod-pov" in "eu-west-1" region is ready
```

After this command finishes, check that `eksctl` also created the kubeconfig properly by running the command `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`. If deployed correctly one should see the list of pods in a pending state.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

This should result in:

```
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coredns-5947f47f5f-79vqv   0/1     Pending   0          22m
coredns-5947f47f5f-97f8m   0/1     Pending   0          22m
```

**Calico Installation**

This is following the instructions provided by [Tigera](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/getting-started/kubernetes/managed-public-cloud/eks).

To install Calico, first remove the default AWS-provided networking component:

```bash
kubectl delete daemonset -n kube-system aws-node
```

Install the Calico manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/manifests/calico-vxlan.yaml
```

Now configure Calico for EKS-specific support with the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system set env daemonset/calico-node FELIX_AWSSRCDSTCHECK=Disable
```

**SSH Access to nodegroups**

`eksctl` allows for [ssh keys](https://eksctl.io/usage/schema/#managedNodeGroups-ssh) to be added to your nodegroups for troubleshooting. By default, the `gitpod-cluster.yaml` does not configure this. AWS Systems Manager is enabled by default, allowing for connectivity [through multiple methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html) to each instance in your nodegroup.

**Create the gitpod nodegroup**

Once the Calico CNI has been provisioned the gitpod nodegroup can be created.

Create the Gitpod nodegroup:

```bash
eksctl create nodegroup --include=default --config-file gitpod-cluster.yaml
```

This should result in:

```
2022-08-11 22:52:10 [ℹ]  nodegroup "default" will use "ami-0733d755ed2c97a4d" [Ubuntu2004/1.22]
2022-08-11 22:52:13 [ℹ]  combined include rules: default
2022-08-11 22:52:13 [ℹ]  1 nodegroup (default) was included (based on the include/exclude rules)
2022-08-11 22:52:13 [ℹ]  will create a CloudFormation stack for each of 1 managed nodegroups in cluster "gitpod-pov"
[...]
2022-08-11 22:56:53 [ℹ]  node "ip-192-168-104-44.eu-west-1.compute.internal" is ready
2022-08-11 22:56:53 [✔]  created 1 managed nodegroup(s) in cluster "gitpod-pov"
2022-08-11 22:56:57 [ℹ]  checking security group configuration for all nodegroups
2022-08-11 22:56:57 [ℹ]  all nodegroups have up-to-date cloudformation templates
```

You can verify that your installation was deployed properly with the custom `kubectl` command provided below which will let you review maxpods, kernel and containerd versions to ensure they are meeting [our minimum requirements](../../latest/cluster-set-up) as intended.

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o=custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,\
RUNTIME:.status.nodeInfo.containerRuntimeVersion,\
MAXPODS:.status.capacity.pods,\
KERNEL:.status.nodeInfo.kernelVersion,\
AMIFAMILY:.status.nodeInfo.osImage,\
K8S:.status.nodeInfo.kubeletVersion,\
Instance-ID:.spec.providerID"
```

**Enable cluster autoscaling**

Gitpod's resource usage will vary depending on the number of active workspaces and image prebuilds during the day. The use of a cluster autoscaler is recommended to provision and remove EKS nodes on demand.

```bash
CLUSTER_NAME="gitpod-pov"
AWS_REGION="eu-west-1"

helm repo add autoscaler https://kubernetes.github.io/autoscaler
helm repo update
helm upgrade \
    --atomic \
    --cleanup-on-fail \
    --install \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --reset-values \
    --wait \
    --set cloudProvider=aws \
    --set awsRegion=$AWS_REGION \
    --set autoDiscovery.clusterName=$CLUSTER_NAME \
    --set rbac.serviceAccount.create=false \
    --set rbac.serviceAccount.name=cluster-autoscaler \
    --set securityContext.fsGroup=65534 \
    --set extraArgs.skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false \
    --set extraArgs.skip-nodes-with-system-pods=false \
    --set extraArgs.expander=least-waste \
    --set extraArgs.balance-similar-node-groups=true \
    --set extraArgs.scale-down-utilization-threshold=0.2 \
    --set extraArgs.v=2 \
    autoscaler autoscaler/cluster-autoscaler
```

**Deleting the cluster**

When deleting this cluster following your proof of value evaluation, any additional resources added to the VPC will need to be deleted before deleting the cluster, otherwise, cloudformations will fail to delete the VPC and complete deleting the cluster. The alternative is to create a VPC managed separately and install EKS using the additions for working [with existing VPCs](https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-networking/#use-existing-vpc-other-custom-configuration) in `eksctl`.

Full removal of the installed components would look something like this (commands are grouped for brevity):

```bash
eksctl delete cluster --name gitpod --force --disable-nodegroup-eviction --wait

#### The following removal steps are optional; if you plan on creating another Gitpod installation then the S3 bucket,
#### access account, key, and policy can be kept for later use.

#### delete s3 resources
aws s3 rm s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME} --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME} --force

#### delete iam resources
aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name gitpod-s3-access --policy-arn 'arn:aws:iam::12344:policy/gitpod_s3_access_policy'

# delete access keys:
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name gitpod-s3-access
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name gitpod-s3-access --access-key-id AKI---------
aws iam delete-user --user-name gitpod-s3-access

# ensure that nothing else is attached to this policy
aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn 'arn:aws:iam::12344:policy/gitpod_s3_access_policy'
aws iam delete-policy --policy-arn 'arn:aws:iam::12344:policy/gitpod_s3_access_policy'
```

## Install Gitpod

Congratulations. You have set up your cluster. Now, you are ready to install Gitpod. Follow the instructions of the [installation guide](../installing-gitpod).

If you followed the steps to create your infrastructure of this guide, you need to use the following config settings for your Gitpod installation:

| General settings |                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Domain name      | value of `$DOMAIN` |

Keep cert-manager selected for the TLS certificates options.

This guide describes a single-cluster reference architecture for Gitpod aimed at production environments: continuous deployments of Gitpod used in anger by your engineers. It consists of a Kubernetes cluster, cert-manager, external MySQL database, external OCI image registry, and external object storage. It includes instructions on how to set up this reference architecture on the officially supported cloud providers.

This reference architecture can be used as a blueprint for your Gitpod installation: Start with this reference architecture and adapt it to your needs. The reference architecture as described in this guide is what Gitpod supports, and is used to test against every self-hosted Gitpod release.

To use Gitpod, you also need a Git source code management system (SCM) like GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket. You will find the supported SCMs in the [product compatibility matrix](/docs/references/compatibility?admin) your own SCM is beyond the scope of this guide. However, you can simply use the cloud versions of GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket as well as the possible existing installation in your corporate network.

# Self-Hosted Gitpod Releases and Versioning

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**
>
> The last official update of this product is the [November 2022 self-hosted release](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). We no longer sell commercial self-hosted licenses. If you want to self-host Gitpod, you can still request our [free community license](https://www.gitpod.io/community-license). However, we no longer offer support or updates for it.

### Release Policy

Gitpod Self-Hosted is released once a month, usually at the end of each month. The versioning schema is: `YYYY.MM.V`. Each new version of self-hosted Gitpod includes all of the changes made to Gitpod up to the release date. This means that the self-hosted version of Gitpod is at most one month behind the SaaS version. Outside of the regular monthly releases, hot-fix releases are possible to add functionality or fix bugs. Hot fix releases increment the `V` in the aforementioned versioning schema.

### Support Policy

Gitpod is committed to supporting the last 2 versions of self-hosted Gitpod with patches and security updates.

### Roll out Policy

New versions are first rolled out to all users that are on the `community` license, i.e. are on the stable branch. Customers with a paid license receive the newest version one week later.

### Testing Policy

<!-- ToDo: link to reference architecture once this is shipped -->

For each release, we validate that core Gitpod workflows function as expected via a series of automated and manual tests. These tests are performed on different Gitpod installations running on our [reference architectures](../latest/reference-architecture). This should help ensure that Gitpod works for you, assuming your architecture is close to the reference architecture.

Gitpod has certain expectations on the characteristics of the cluster it is running on as well as the (software) components connected to it.

> Please refer to the [product compatibility matrix](/docs/references/compatibility?admin) for the supported types and versions of these components.

## Cluster Requirements

![cluster requirements](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/cluster-requirements.png)

<!-- raw editable diagram can be found under static/images/docs/self-hosted/cluster-requirements.excalidraw -->

### Reference Architectures

We have created a set of [reference architectures](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture) for all the major cloud providers that fulfill the requirements below. These are intended as a starting point for you to create an environment to install Gitpod into. If you wish to use K3s, please refer to the [k3s guide](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/cluster-set-up/on-k3s). Please see the [product compatibility matrix](/docs/references/compatibility?admin) for the current level of k3s support.

### Supported Kubernetes Versions and distributions

Please refer to the [product compatibility matrix](/docs/references/compatibility?admin) for supported Kubernetes versions and distributions.

### Node Affinity Labels Requirements

Your Kubernetes cluster must have node(s) with the following labels applied to them:

- `gitpod.io/workload_meta=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_ide=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_services=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_regular=true`
- `gitpod.io/workload_workspace_headless=true`

It is recommended to have a minimum of two node pools, grouping the `meta` and `ide` nodes into one node pool and `workspace` related nodes into another. These two groups of workloads have different performance characteristics. Separating them into node pools after the fact is more difficult and incurs downtime. A further improvement is to also separate the headless workspaces (these are [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds)) and regular workspaces into separate node pools. Prebuilds can use up a lot of compute and this might impact regular workspaces if they are running on the same node.

### Node and Container Requirements

These are the components expected on each node (see [product compatibility matrix](/docs/references/compatibility?admin) for supported versions):

- Ubuntu Linux
- Calico for the networking overlay and network policy
- Containerd
- At least 4 vCPU and 16GB of RAM

### Kubernetes Privilege Requirements

Your Kubernetes cluster must allow Gitpod to run privileged pods, as Gitpod depends on these privileges to provide workspace isolation.

### Load Balancer Requirements

Gitpod uses [`LoadBalancer` type services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) to expose the Gitpod Dashboard, browser-based IDEs, and SSH connections used by desktop IDEs. Your Kubernetes cluster must be able to provision layer 4 or layer 7 load balancers for `LoadBalancer` type services that can route HTTP(S) connections to Gitpod services. If you intend to use desktop IDEs or SSH to workspaces then your cluster must also be able to provision layer 4 load balancers that can route SSH connection to Gitpod services.

All supported Kubernetes distributions provide load balancers that meet Gitpod's needs. For more information see the Kubernetes distribution documentation below:

- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service-load-balancer)
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Engine:
  - Layer 4/7 (default): [Classic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/eks-kubernetes-services-cluster/)
  - Layer 4 only: [Network Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-load-balancing.html)
- [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-network)
- [K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/networking/#service-load-balancer)

## Required Components

Gitpod relies on certain components and services for it to function. By default, most of these can be automatically installed in-cluster during installation. However, you can also configure Gitpod to use your own version of these that may or may not live inside the cluster. We recommend using external components when running Gitpod for sustained usage because this avoids the risk of data loss when the cluster goes down.

> Please refer to the [product compatibility matrix](/docs/references/compatibility?admin) for the supported types and versions of these components.

| Component                                                                                                            | Required?                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [Bucket Storage](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/requirements#bucket-storage)                                     | Use default or bring your own  |
| [Database](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/requirements#database)                                                 | Use default or bring your own  |
| [Image Registry](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/requirements#image-registry)                                     | Use default or bring your own  |
| [Source Control Management System](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/requirements#source-control-management-system) | Yes (cloud or self-hosted SCM) |
| [Cert-manager](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/requirements#cert-manager)                                         | Yes                            |

### Bucket Storage

By default, MinIO is installed in the cluster to store static content and to back an in-cluster image registry. During the installation process you can also configure Gitpod to use an external storage providers like S3.

### Database

Gitpod uses a MySQL database to store user data. By default Gitpod ships with a MySQL database built-in and data is stored using a Kubernetes PersistentVolume. For production settings, we recommend operating your own MySQL database (version v5.7 or newer). Which database is used can be configured during installation. <!--- todo: Is this true? How do you configure this? --->

### Image Registry

Gitpod relies on an image registry to store images used to start workspaces. By default, a docker based image registry backed by MiniIO is installed in the cluster (this can be configured during the installation). However, Gitpod is also compatible with any registry that implements the [Docker Registry HTTP API V2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) specification.

### Source Control Management System

Gitpod expects to be connected to a Source Control Management System (SCM) such as GitLab in order to function. You can find out more about which SCMs are supported and how to connect to them in the [Integrations](/docs/configure/authentication) section. You will also be guided through connecting your SCM once you access your Gitpod installation for the first time.

### Cert Manager

[Cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) must be installed in your cluster before you can install Gitpod. It is used to create and manage certificates needed to secure communication between the various internal Gitpod components. It can also be used to fetch a TLS certificate for your Gitpod instance from Let's Encrypt for example. Please consider the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) on how to install it.

Gitpod has three resource dependencies that are required to function correctly. For convenience, you can use the in-cluster dependencies, but you should use external resources for a high-performance application.

This page highlights some of the common gotchas found when working with cloud resources and how to overcome them.

## Container Registry

### [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

Amazon ECR does not fully implement the [Docker v2 API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api), namely it does not automatically create the remote image if it does not already exist when pushed. For that reason, ECR is not supported with Gitpod.

When using AWS, you should select an in-cluster registry and use S3 as your in-cluster storage provider. This will use the in-cluster registry as a facade for an S3 bucket where all the images will be stored.

If using a region other than `us-east-1`, you will need to change the endpoint to be `s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`.

### [Google Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)

> This example uses the format `gcr.io`, which is the global hostnames. This can be swapped with any of the [regional hostnames](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling) and it will work in the same way.

Google Container Registry authentication requires specific configuration. The "Container registry URL" will be in a format similar to `gcr.io/<project-name>/gitpod`. In order for the authentication to work, you must also enter the "Container registry server". This will always be your GCR hostname, eg `gcr.io`.

### [Google Artifact Registry (GAR)](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry)

As with [GCR](#google-container-registry-gcr), Google Artifact Registry requires both the "Container registry URL" and "Container registry server" to be completed. The URL will be in the format `<region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project-name>/gitpod` and the server address will be `<region>-docker.pkg.dev`.

Sometimes it becomes necessary to stop Gitpod workspaces (in a `<namespace>`). Usually this needs to be done when updating Gitpod. Please see the [update guide](./updating) for more information.

This can be done with `kubectl`, and when done so, the IDE is closed, data in `/workspace` is backed up, and then the pod finally terminates.

## A Single Workspace

```shell
$ kubectl delete pods <workspace-or-headless-pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

## All Workspaces

> **Caution**: This will delete all actively running workspaces.

Can be done prior to outage windows, or for troubleshooting.

```shell
$ kubectl delete pods -l component=workspace -n <namespace>
```

# Generating a Support Bundle

Something is wrong with your Gitpod installation? This guide shows you how you can create a support bundle.

At first, you need to start the installation admin console. In a terminal with configured `kubectl` run the following command (`<namespace>` is the Kubernetes namespace your Gitpod installation has been installed to):

```shell
$ kubectl kots admin-console --namespace <namespace>
```

Open your favorite browser and go to `http://localhost:8800` (port `8800` is opened on your node on `localhost` only--you may want to forward the port to your workstation to access the admin console). Enter your password and click on “Troubleshoot” in the top menu. Click “Analyze Gitpod” to create a support bundle that contains relevant logs and configs.

![kots-troubleshoot](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-troubleshoot.png)

Creating the support bundle will take some while. Once it is ready, you can inspect the content. Nothing will be shared with us unless you have explicitly chosen to do so.

We optionally collect telemetry from Gitpod Self-Hosted installations to better understand the needs and use cases of the Gitpod community. Collected telemetry contains simple usage statistics like the number of users and workspaces. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.gitpod.io/privacy) describes in detail how we use this data.

To provide individualized support to enterprise customers we optionally collect a customer ID. This customer ID provides insights into enterprise adoption of Gitpod and helps us ensure that customers get the best value from their installations. Self-hosted installations using the community license do not have a customer ID and will be anonymous.

## Controlling your telemetry

You can preview your usage telemetry, control how much information you share, and enable/disable all usage telemetry on `Settings` tab on the `Admin` dashboard. To anonymize your usage telemetry, uncheck the **Include customer ID in telemetry** option. To fully disable telemetry, uncheck the **Enable usage telemetry** option.

A preview of your usage telemetry is available on the settings page to provide transparency about the data we'd like to collect.

# How to Update your Gitpod Installation

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**
>
> The last official update of this product is the [November 2022 self-hosted release](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). We no longer sell commercial self-hosted licenses. If you want to self-host Gitpod, you can still request our [free community license](https://www.gitpod.io/community-license). However, we no longer offer support or updates for it.

At first, you must decide on an [update strategy](#update-strategies), and follow related instructions.

After following instructions for your desired update strategy, you need to start the installation admin console. In a terminal with configured `kubectl` run the following command (`<namespace>` is the Kubernetes namespace your Gitpod installation has been installed to):

```shell
$ kubectl kots admin-console --namespace <namespace>
```

Open `http://localhost:8800` (port `8800` is opened on your node on `localhost` only—you may want to forward the port to your workstation to access the admin console). Enter your password. Click on “Check for update”.

> **Note:** For air gapped installations, you need to click `Upload a new version` to upload a new version and then deploy it. A new version is made available to you to download via the download portal provided to you by Gitpod.

When an update is available, you will be asked to deploy the new version. You can run preflight checks on the new version and when you press deploy your current running version will be updated.

In most cases, updates should work without further effort - and your existing data is carried over. In some cases (with breaking changes) we will provide instructions on how to upgrade to a specific version in our [Update Guides](../latest/upgrade-guides).

> Gitpod allows you to [apply custom labels, annotations and environment variables to your resources](./advanced/customization). When using this feature, you will need to manually delete resources that have immutable labels on them for updates to take effect. See the [documentation](./advanced/customization#limitations) for full details.

![kots-admin-dashboard](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/kots-admin-dashboard.png)

## Update Strategies

You can deploy different strategies to update your Gitpod instance. Each strategy comes with trade-offs regarding downtime, risk, and cost. In any case, you should ensure that the chosen strategy matches your (company’s) risk profile and that every part of your update strategy (incl. rollbacks) is regularly practiced.

Please refer to [Update Guides](../latest/upgrade-guides) to check for breaking changes that need to be handled as part of your upgrade.

### Maintenance Window (Higher downtime, low risk and medium cost) - Recommended

> **Important:** [Single Cluster Reference Architecture](../latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) is not highly-available, please [stop workspaces](./stop-workspaces) and [prevent workspace starts](./prevent-workspace-starts) prior to proceeding.

In this strategy, you have scheduled maintenance windows where you take down your entire Gitpod installation, update it, test it, and then make it available again. Ideally, this is done during times of low demand, e.g. outside of work hours.

### Secondary Staging Deployment (medium downtime, lower risk, higher cost)

> **Important:** [Single Cluster Reference Architecture](../latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) is not highly-available, please [stop workspaces](./stop-workspaces) and [prevent workspace starts](./prevent-workspace-starts) prior to proceeding.

In this strategy, you run the newest version of Gitpod on a secondary (staging) cluster to ensure compatibility/fitness of the newest version within your specific environment. Given that you are testing on a secondary cluster, you save on downtime in your primary cluster. If you are confident in the release, you can then also apply the update to your primary cluster. Given that workspace startups may fail for a brief period _during_ the update process, a maintenance window (albeit smaller) will still be required.

### Live update (not available, yet)

> **Important:** Please check back soon, we're planning high-availability [reference architecture](../latest/reference-architecture).

The [Single Cluster Reference Architecture](../latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) does not support live update. Please choose another update strategy.

# Upgrade Guides and Breaking Changes

This page informs you if there are specific considerations to take into account when upgrading to a specific version. If no breaking changes and thus specific recommendations when updating are mentioned here (or if they do not apply to you), please follow the normal upgrade procedure mentioned on the [Updating your Gitpod Installation](../latest/updating) page.

## 2022.09

### Security

This release includes security fixes addressing information leakage in logs; see the [security announcement log](https://www.gitpod.io/security/log) for more information.

### Breaking Changes

- [Single Cluster Reference Architecture](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) changes:
  - Regular workspaces and headless workspaces are isolated to separate node pools to help avoid noisy neighbor issues between the two and guarantee maximum performance for workspaces
  - Workspace Services (such as `ws-manager`) are deployed to the services nodepool to prevent potential service degradation from high `ws-daemon` memory use.
  - We've increased the default node size to 16 core / 64 GB nodes. This is to allow for more workspaces per node, and avoid the scenario where there is just one workspace per node. We've also added [documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/configuring-workspace-resources) to detail our recommendations around workspace resources.

## 2022.08

> There is no expected impact from these changes if using KOTS. These are documented for transparency purposes only.
> **Custom labels from the pod selector labels removed**

[11954](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/11954): remove custom labels from the pod selector labels. This removes this [limitation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/advanced/customization#limitations) so this is a long-term improvement. The impact of this should be handled transparently for you by the KOTS installer.

**Usage of PodSecurityPolicies removed**

[12336](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/12336): Removal of PodSecurityPolicies. These were deprecated from Kubernetes 1.21 and removed from 1.25. This allows Gitpod to run on Kubernetes 1.25+, which is scheduled for imminent release. If you have PodSecurityPolicies enabled on your cluster, we suggest you disable them as soon as possible. If an installation is deployed to a cluster with PSPs enabled, you will need to add `experimental.common.usePodSecurityPolicies = true` to a [config-patch file](./config-patches) - however, do note that this is deprecated and exists to ease the transition away from PSPs.

## 2022.07

### Setting the service type of the proxy component

You can now configure the service type of the proxy service in the installation UI (see image below) - you do not need to upload a `.yaml` file as a [config patch](./config-patches) anymore to configure this. However, having it in the config patch will still work until December.

![proxy service type UI](../../static/images/docs/self-hosted/proxy-service-type-ui.png)

### Setting the default workspace image and which image registries the default image can be pulled from

We've moved the configuration of the default workspace image and the default base image registry whitelist out of the experimental section of the [config-patch](../latest/config-patches) file. The latter was also renamed. Using them in the experimental section will still work for the time being (until approx. December 2022).

**Before:**

```yaml
experimental:
  webApp:
    server:
      defaultBaseImageRegistryWhitelist:
        - <allowed registries>
    workspaceDefaults:
      workspaceImage: <path to your default workspace image>
```

**After:**

```yaml
workspace:
  workspaceImage: <path to your default workspace image>
containerRegistry:
  privateBaseImageAllowList:
    - <allowed registries>
```

# Access Tokens

> Access Tokens are currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/14280).

Access Tokens are secrets that allow you to interact with Gitpod through Gitpod APIs. When you use an Access Token, all actions performed with the token assume the same level of authorization of the Access Token user.

![Create Access Token](../../../static/images/docs/access-token-create.png)

## Permissions (Scopes)

Each Access Token either has:

- No Access.
- Full Access to Resources and APIs which the token owner also has access to.

By default, an Access Token has **No Access**. You need to explicitly select Full Access to succesfully authorize.

In the future, we will expand Access Tokens with fine grained permissions.

## Expiration

All Access Tokens have an expiration time. When a token expires, requests made with the token will fail with Unathorized. When a token expires, you can [regenerate](#regenerating-access-tokens) it.

## Managing Access Tokens

### Listing Access Tokens

You can list your Access Tokens in your user Settings, or by going to [gitpod.io/tokens](https://gitpod.io/tokens).

![List Access Tokens](../../../static/images/docs/access-token-list.png)

### Creating an Access Token

You can create an Access Token by navigating to [gitpod.io/tokens](https://gitpod.io/tokens) or through Settings > Access Tokens. Clicking **New Access Token** will prompt you to specify details of the token.

- Your access tokens will automatically expire after the specified duration.
- Once you create an Access Token, it will be shown to you **once**. Make sure you store it in a secure place, you will not be able to retrieve it again.

## Updating an Access Token

Access Token can be updated. You can update the following properties on a token:

- Name
- Permission scopes

When you update a token, the token secret remains unaffected and you can continue to use it, until it expires.

## Regenerating Access Tokens

Access Token can be regenerated. Regenerating a token will:

- Create a new token secret, which you'll need to store in a secure place and replace your old one.
- The new token will have a new expiration time.
- The old token will no longer be valid and will receive Unathorized when interacting with APIs.

## Deleting Access Tokens

Personal Access token can be deleted. Once deleted, the token is no longer valid for interaction with APIs.

# Browser Bookmarklet

Creating a workspace is as easy as prefixing any GitHub URL with `gitpod.io/#`.

For convenience, we developed a Gitpod browser bookmarklet as an alternative to [installing our browser extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension) that does the
prefixing for you - as simple as that.

1. Drag the following image to your bookmark bar.

![Open in Gitpod](../../../static/images/docs/browser-bookmarklet.png)

2. Select all of the code below and then copy it to your clipboard.

```javascript
javascript: (() => {
  "use strict";
  (function () {
    for (
      var t = document.getElementsByTagName("meta"), n = 0;
      n < t.length;
      n++
    ) {
      var o = t[n];
      if (o.content.toLowerCase().includes("gitlab")) return !0;
      if ("hostname" === o.name && o.content.includes("github")) return !0;
      if (
        "application-name" === o.name &&
        o.content.toLowerCase().includes("bitbucket")
      )
        return !0;
    }
    return !1;
  })() &&
    window.open(
      ("https://gitpod.io",
      "https://gitpod.io/#" +
        (window.location.protocol + "//" + window.location.host) +
        window.location.pathname)
    );
})();
```

3. Right-click edit the bookmark and replace the contents of the URL field with the code that is in your clipboard:

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-bookmarklet-edit.png)

4. Done! Next time you are viewing a repository on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket press the bookmarklet to open the repository in Gitpod.

## Use with Gitpod Self-Hosted

If you are using Gitpod Self-Hosted you can still use the browser bookmarklet by configuring it with your self-hosted URL by replacing the `gitpod.io` URL with your self-hosted URL in the bookmarklet code.

```javascript
window.open(("https://gitpod.io","https://gitpod.io/#
```

## Source Code

Gitpod's browser bookmarklet is open source. You can check out its [source code](https://github.com/gitpod-io/browser-bookmarklet), or even open it in Gitpod:

# Browser Extension

Creating a workspace is as easy as prefixing any GitHub URL with `gitpod.io/#`.

For convenience, we developed a Gitpod browser extension. It adds a button to GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket that does the
prefixing for you - as simple as that.

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

We provide the extension for:

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) - also works for Edge, Brave and other Chromium-based browsers.
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/)

## Access the extension settings

1. Right-click on the Gitpod extension icon.
2. Select `Options` for chrome based browsers. For Firefox, select `Manage Extension` and then `Preferences`.

<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Gitpod browser extension configuration" src="/images/docs/beta/integrations/new-browser-extension-options.png">

## Use a custom Gitpod instance URL

If you are using custom Gitpod instance (e.g. [dedicated](https://www.gitpod.io/dedicated)) you can still use the browser extension by configuring it with your instance URL

After you have installed the extension go to the options panel and enter your custom Gitpod instance URL.

<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Gitpod browser extension configuration" src="/images/docs/beta/integrations/browser-extension-options.png">

## Open repositories with <Keybind>.</Keybind> (dot) keybind

Toggle on the `Enable . keybind to open repositories in Gitpod` option in the Gitpod extension [preferences/options](#accessing-the-extension-optionspreferences). After doing this, whenever you hit <Keybind>.</Keybind> on GitHub or GitLab, the current repository will open in Gitpod.

title: Dotfiles

<script context="module">
  export const prerender = true;
</script>

# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are a way to customize your developer environment according to your personal needs.

To configure Gitpod to use your own dotfiles for all your workspaces, enter the URL of a dotfiles repository in [your user preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences).

`youtube: 00dif9QWXNU`

## Custom installation script

Gitpod will recognize and run one of the following install scripts from your dotfiles repository.

- install.sh
- install
- bootstrap.sh
- bootstrap
- script/bootstrap
- setup.sh
- setup
- script/setup

Note: Your installation script will be terminated if it exceeds 120 seconds.

Make sure to make your installation script executable with `chmod 755 <install-script-name>.sh` before committing and pushing to your dotfiles repository.

If there is no install script, your dotfiles will be symlinked into `/home/gitpod`.

## Example

> You can refer this [demo-dotfiles template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-dotfiles) to bring your dotfiles to Gitpod.

The example below has just one dotfile called `.bash_aliases`. If this file is present in a workspace home directory, it will be found by the '.bashrc' startup script in the Gitpod default image, so no additional install script is required.

**.bash_aliases**

```sh
echo Hello Gitpod
echo Here is my .bash_aliases dotfile

alias gitsha='git rev-parse HEAD'
```

### Troubleshooting

The dotfiles repository installation logs are saved to `/home/gitpod/.dotfiles.log` and can be viewed via

```bash
cat /home/gitpod/.dotfiles.log
```

## FAQs

### How to debug or test dotfiles changes inside an existing workspace without creating a new one each time?

If you want to quickly test out dotfiles inside an existing workspace created from your `dotfiles` repository, you can run the below command snippet in your terminal as a workaround:

```bash
gitpod_evars="${!GITPOD_*}" gp_evars="${!GP_*}"; for k in ${gitpod_evars:-} ${gp_evars:-}; do dargs+=(-e "${k}"); done; docker run "${dargs[@]}" --net=host --rm -v $PWD:/home/gitpod/.dotfiles -v /workspace:/workspace -v /ide:/ide -v /usr/bin/gp:/usr/bin/gp:ro -v /.supervisor:/.supervisor -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --privileged -it gitpod/workspace-full bash -c 'trap "echo -e \"=== Run \033[1;32mexit\033[0m command to leave debug workspace\"; exec bash -li" EXIT ERR; echo "PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n \\\"[debug-workspace] \\\"; \$PROMPT_COMMAND\"" >> $HOME/.bashrc; eval "$(gp env -e)"; dot_path="${HOME}/.dotfiles"; for s in install setup bootstrap; do if p="${dot_path}/${s}" && test -x "${p}" || p="${p}.sh" && test -x "${p}"; then set +m; "$p"; set -m; exit; fi; done; while read -r file; do rf_path="${file#"${dot_path}"/}"; target_file="${HOME}/${rf_path}"; target_dir="${target_file%/*}"; if test ! -d "$target_dir"; then mkdir -p "$target_dir"; fi; ln -sf "$file" "$target_file"; done < <(find "${dot_path}" -type f);'
```

This will simulate a fake minimal workspace inside your existing Gitpod workspace using `docker`, where your dotfiles will be installed so you can easily test.

For convenience, you can create a file called `debug.sh` in your dotfiles repository and paste the snippet there. You could then run `bash debug.sh` to use it.

### How to install symlinks from dotfiles when using a [custom installation script](#custom-installation-script)?

When you commit a custom script such as `install.sh` in your dotfiles repository, Gitpod will no longer auto symlink your dotfiles under `$HOME` for you. It is by design so that you can have full control of how your dotfiles gets installed. An example of setting up a symlinking step is described below:

- Create a directory called `home_files` inside your dotfiles repository. You can place your .dotfiles in the `home_files` directory, that means you could put files like `.zshrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `.config/nvim/` and etc. in there.
- In your [custom installation script](#custom-installation-script) (e.g. `install.sh`), use/append the below snippet:

```bash
current_dir="$(cd -- "$( dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd)"
dotfiles_source="${current_dir}/home_files"

while read -r file; do

    relative_file_path="${file#"${dotfiles_source}"/}"
    target_file="${HOME}/${relative_file_path}"
    target_dir="${target_file%/*}"

    if test ! -d "${target_dir}"; then
        mkdir -p "${target_dir}"
    fi

    printf 'Installing dotfiles symlink %s\n' "${target_file}"
    ln -sf "${file}" "${target_file}"

done < <(find "${dotfiles_source}" -type f)
```

### [It it possible to cache the dotfiles installation?](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1072003259075657849)

<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

If your dotfiles installation relies on some heavy dependencies, that can take some time to install by nature.

So, everytime you start a workspace, you may have to wait for the dotfiles installation to complete before you can enter the workspace.

For some cases, you can start the commands in background from your `install.sh`, by adding `& disown` at the end of a command:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-user-static & disown
```

This is a good workaround, so your workspace can start early and the long-running commands from your dotfiles installation script can happen in parallel.

But it may not work if you are installing a SHELL (e.g. `zsh`) or a dependency of something else that has to start before your dotfiles can get installed.

> ❗️ PuTTY for Windows is not a supported client

### Create an SSH key

Check to see if you already have an SSH key on your **local** machine. The key is typically located at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on macOS / Linux, and the `.ssh` directory in your user profile folder on Windows (for example `C:\Users\your-user\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub`).

If you do not have a key, run the following command in a **local** terminal / PowerShell to generate an SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

You will then be prompted to enter a secure passphrase, but you can leave that blank. You should now have a `id_ed25519.pub` file which contains your new public SSH key.

> **Note**: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, you can use rsa instead: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`

> **Tip:** Don't have `ssh-keygen`? Install [a supported SSH client](#installing-a-supported-ssh-client).

### SSH file and folder permissions

**macOS / Linux:**

On your local machine, make sure the following permissions are set:

| Folder / File                             | Permissions                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `.ssh` in your user folder                | `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`                |
| `.ssh/config` in your user folder         | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`         |
| `.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` in your user folder | `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` |
| Any other key file                        | `chmod 600 /path/to/key/file`     |

**Windows:**

The specific expected permissions can vary depending on the exact SSH implementation you are using. We recommend using the out of box [Windows 10 OpenSSH Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview).

In this case, make sure that all of the files in the `.ssh` folder for your remote user on the SSH host is owned by you and no other user has permissions to access it. See the [Windows OpenSSH wiki](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH) for details.

For all other clients, consult your client's documentation for what the implementation expects.

### Upload an SSH key to Gitpod

Once you've created an SSH key pair, you can upload your public SSH key to Gitpod, by navigating to [gitpod.io/keys](https://gitpod.io/keys) where you can upload one or more public SSH keys.

![SSH page of the Gitpod dashboard](/images/docs/ssh-key-upload-dark-theme.png)
![SSH page of the Gitpod dashboard](/images/docs/ssh-key-upload-light-theme.png)

Paste your public key, and give your key a memorable title so that you can remember the name of the public key later if you choose to add multiple keys, e.g. "Gitpod Bastion Host SSH Key"

![Adding an SSH Key to Gitpod](/images/docs/new-ssh-key-light-theme.png)
![Adding an SSH Key to Gitpod](/images/docs/new-ssh-key-dark-theme.png)

### Edit an SSH key in Gitpod

Gitpod doesn't support editing an SSH key.

To update an SSH key, delete the key and re-upload the SSH key to Gitpod.

### Delete an SSH key from Gitpod

To delete an SSH key, click the kebab menu to the right of the SSH key in the dashboard and select "delete".

![Deleting an SSH key from Gitpod](/images/docs/delete-ssh-key-light-theme.png)
![Deleting an SSH key from Gitpod](/images/docs/delete-ssh-key-dark-theme.png)

## SSH Gateway

SSH Gateway facilitates connection via SSH for direct SSH access using uploaded public keys, and using the workspace owner token. Both the [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode) and [JetBrains](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) integrations use SSH Gateway to connect to Gitpod workspaces.

### What is SSH Gateway?

SSH Gateway is an intermediary service within Gitpod that proxies incoming SSH requests to the appropriate running workspaces.

![SSH Gateway architecture in Gitpod](/images/ssh-gateway/ssh-gateway-dark-theme.png)
![SSH Gateway architecture in Gitpod](/images/ssh-gateway/ssh-gateway-light-theme.png)

### SSH Gateway in Self-Hosted

If you are running a [Self-Hosted](https://www.gitpod.io/self-hosted) Gitpod installation, you will need to ensure that:

1. The installation has the SSH Gateway component configured and deployed
2. Your networking and firewalls are configured to allow SSH traffic via port `22`.

See the [Self-Hosted Reference Architectures](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture) for more.

# Troubleshooting

[VS Code Desktop and SSH explained](/blog/vscode-desktop-ssh-updates#diagnosing--fixing-common-ssh-connection-issues) blog has a bunch of good troubleshooting notes, you may check them out.

## unix_listener: path "/somewhere/xyz" too long for Unix domain socket

- Open your SSH `config` file in a text editor. (i.e. `~/.ssh/config` or `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`[[1](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config)])
- Append the following to it:

```
Host *.gitpod.io
     ControlPath /tmp/%r-gitpod
```

- Save the file.
- Now try connecting via SSH or VSCode-Desktop again.

# Collaboration & Sharing of Workspaces

There are currently two ways to share a Gitpod workspace, either by creating a [workspace snapshot](#sharing-snapshots), a "point in time" capture of a workspace state that can be then opened by another user. Or, by [sharing a running workspace](#sharing-running-workspaces) which shares access to a single running workspace to multiple users.

`youtube: HcKlXfKpolM`

## Workspace Snapshots

Snapshotting a workspace is useful when you want to create reproducible workspace state for reporting support issues, or when giving training, or presentations. You can create up to three snapshots from any workspace.

You can create a snapshot URL of your workspace to share your workspace files with others. Following a Gitpod snapshot URL starts a new workspace, but under the account of the user who followed that original snapshot URL.

There are a few important things to note about workspace snapshots:

- **Snapshots behave like workspace restarts** - All workspace state, including files changed since the original workspace start are preserved in a snapshot. Any tasks or processes typically launched via a workspace start will not run for a workspace snapshot.

- **Access to secret information** - Snapshotted workspaces do not grant access to Gitpod environment variables, Gitpod authentication or Git credentials within a snapshot. However, you should use caution that you did not store any secret or private information in any files of a workspace snapshot before generating a snapshot URL.

- **Deleting and managing snapshots** - If you want to remove any created snapshot URLs, deleting the workspace directly removes any created snapshot URLs associated with that workspace.

- **Users must have repository access** - Each workspace snapshot creates a new unique URL. Access to a snapshot is based on the access rules on the repository the workspace is based on. This means snapshots based on private repositories can only be opened by those with access to the repository. Public repository snapshots can be accessed without authentication.

> **Note:** Caution should always be taken when sharing potentially sensitive information, including Gitpod workspace snapshots. If you are concerned you have accidentally shared sensitive information, we suggest you follow best practices such as immediately rotating credentials and adhere to your typical security response process.

### How To Take a Snapshot URL

## Sharing Running Workspaces

Sharing running workspaces makes it possible to quickly look at a workspace together with a (remote) colleague. It is similar to collaborating on Google Docs, in that you can see who is online and look at the same code and processes.

To share your workspace, navigate to the workspaces page at https://gitpod.io/workspaces. From there:

1. Move your mouse over the workspace you want to share (change the filter to All if you don't see your workspace).
1. Click the three dots menu to the right of the highlighted workspace.
1. Click **Share**

This marks your workspace as shared. When you open it, you can copy & share its URL.

> **Note:** You can join shared workspaces only by using VS Code Browser. If you prefer to use another editor, please consider using [external collaboration plugins](#external-collaboration-plugins).

> **Security note:**
>
> Beware, anybody with this URL and a Gitpod account will be able to access the workspace as long as
> it is shared and running.
>
> Every action involving Git in a shared workspace happens on behalf of the workspace owner's account without further authorization. This includes access to secrets used in a shared workspace.
> It is highly recommended to give workspace URLs only to trusted users and unshare workspaces as soon as sharing them is no longer necessary.
>
> **A running Gitpod workspace really is your personal machine.**
>
> At present, this feature cannot be disabled. If this is something you are interested in, please [let us know in this issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6328).

## External Collaboration Plugins

With Gitpod you can also use the following third-party integrations for real-time collaboration:

- [Code Together](https://www.codetogether.com/) - Works on VS Code Desktop, VS Code Browser, and via JetBrains or Eclipse.
- [GitLive](https://git.live/) - Works on VS Code Desktop, VS Code Browser, and via JetBrains.
- [Duckly](https://duckly.com/) - Works on VS Code Desktop and VS Code Browser.

# Multi-repo

> {title} is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8623).

If your software project is comprised of multiple source control repositories it is possible to configure Gitpod to clone these additional repositories through the configuration keys of `additionalRepositories` and `mainConfiguration` in the [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file which removes the need to run multiple workspaces, and makes it easier to configure services which need to be aware of each other.

## Cloning additional repositories

The `additionalRepositories` key is an array of repositories which contains two properties which define the source control `url` to clone and the `checkoutLocation` of where the repository is cloned is under `/workspaces`

```yaml
# example .gitpod.yml from https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend
additionalRepositories:
  - url: https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend
    # checkoutLocation is relative to /workspaces
    checkoutLocation: backend
```

When the above configuration is defined then the following additional steps happen when Gitpod workspace is started:

1. If you open a workspace on a branch, Gitpod will clone the same-named branch in all repositories. If such a branch doesn’t exist Gitpod checks out the default branch.
1. The contents of `https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend` is cloned to `/workspaces/demo-multi-repo-frontend`
1. The contents of `https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend` is cloned to `/workspaces/backend`

After all of the source control repositories have been cloned then the `before`, `init` and `command` [tasks](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) are executed as per normal. If you need to run commands (such as package installation or compilation) on the source control repositories which have been cloned then change your working directory the `checkoutLocation` location using the `before` task.

```yaml
# example .gitpod.yml from https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend
additionalRepositories:
  - url: https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend
    checkoutLocation: backend

tasks:
  - name: backend
    # change working directory as per configured in `checkoutLocation`
    # which is configured above as `/workspaces/backend`
    before: |
      cd ../backend
    init: |
      echo npm install
    command: |
      echo npm run dev

    # changing of working directory is not required as these tasks will
    # by default by executed in `/workspaces/demo-multi-repo-frontend`
  - name: frontend
    init: |
      echo npm install
      echo npm run build
    command: |
      echo npm run dev
```

Try it out at https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend

## Delegating configuration

The optional `mainConfiguration` configuration key when configured in additional repositories points to the repository with the main [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file and makes it possible to open the same workspace from any issue, branch or other context URL from any of the participating repositories. Since the main configuration is used for prebuilds, those will show up under the main project.

```yaml
# example .gitpod.yml from https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend
mainConfiguration: https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend
```

## Adding additional repo folders to VSCode Explorer

![VSCode workspace folders](.../../../static/images/docs/vscode-workspace-folders.png)

You might want to see the [`additionalRepositories`](#cloning-additional-repositories) on your VSCode.

To do so:
  1. Create a file called `main.code-workspace` (for example) on your main(e.g. frontend) repository that everyone is expected to open via Gitpod.
  2. Now you can define the folder paths:
```json
{
  // All paths are relative to your main repo
  // The additional repos are cloned inside /workspace dir
	"folders": [
		{
			"path": "." // Main repo that you will open in Gitpod (e.g. frontend)
		},
		{
			"path": "../backend" // Additional repo
		},
		{
			"path": "../db" // Additional repo
		},
	],

}
```
  3. Specify your `.code-workspace` file path on `.gitpod.yml`:
```yaml
workspaceLocation: frontend/main.code-workspace # Relative to /workspace dir
```

      for reference in "${extra_clone_branches[@]}"; do {
          dir="${main_repo_dir}-${reference}"

          if test ! -e "${dir}" && git -C "${main_repo_dir}" show-ref --quiet "refs/heads/${reference}"; then {
            printf 'INFO: %s\n' "Duplicating ${primary_repo_name} to ${dir} with ${reference} branch"
            cp -ra "${main_repo_dir}" "${dir}"
            git -C "${dir}" checkout "${reference}" 2>&1 | grep -v "Switched to branch '${reference}'"
          } fi
      } done

      # Send signal to awaiting task(s)
      gp sync-done multi_branch

  - name: Some other task
    command: |
      # Wait for multi_branch to avoid race condition
      gp sync-await multi_branch

# Ports

Gitpod supports exposing HTTP ports via a custom domain that is associated with your workspace. You can also use port forwarding, so that you do not need to update your application if it already references the localhost hostname. You can forward all ports using the [local companion](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/local-companion), natively in both [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode), [JetBrains](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) and also via the [command-line](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line) using SSH.

## Default port behaviors

By default, when a port is opening in a Gitpod workspace, Gitpod will:

1. **Direct HTTP traffic** - When an application starts listening to an HTTP port, Gitpod detects the port and exposes it on a URL that requires authentication. Setting the port to "public" would make the port URL accessible to anyone on the internet (or the installed network if using self-hosted Gitpod).
1. **Notify the user** - Gitpod sends the user a popup notification in their [IDE or editor](/docs/references/ides-and-editors) to let the user know that a port has been detected.

    <figcaption>Setting a port public/private in a JetBrains IDE</figcaption>
</figure>

## Accessing port URLs

You can access the dedicated port URL by pre-pending the port number to the workspace URL.

e.g `3000-yourworkspace.ws-eu45.gitpod.io`

You can also print the port URL using the [gp url](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) command (e.g. `gp url 3000`).

And if you prefer listing all open ports URLs at once, use [gp ports list](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) command.

## Configuring port behaviors

To modify or change default port behaviors, update the `ports` section of your [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml).

All changes to port behaviors take effect immediately, not requiring a workspace restart.

**Note:** Some actions (e.g. setting a port public/private) can be taken via the IDE or editor.

### Configure port opening

The port open event is triggered when a new port is detected as open within the workspace.

Port opening behavior can only be set via the [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml)

The property `onOpen` configures port opening behaviors:

- `notify` (default) - Show a notification for newly detected ports.
- `open-preview` - Open the port URL in a preview within the editor or IDE.
- `open-browser` - Open the port URL in a browser tab.
- `ignore` - Ignore default behavior (notify).

**Example**: Open a browser tab for port 8080

```yaml
ports:
  - name: Web App
    description: The main application web server
    port: 8080
    onOpen: open-browser
```

### Specify port names & descriptions

You can give ports a `name` and a `description` (both optional). These properties will help you to add context about what the port is being used for.

The property `visibility` configures who can access a port:

- `private` (default) - Only allow users with workspace access to access the port.
- `public` - Allows everyone with the port URL to access the port.

### Configure port visibility

Port visibility can be set in [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml), changed via the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli), or manually changed within the IDE or editor.

</IdeToggle>

### Configure port ranges

All port configurations can be applied to ranges as well as single ports.

**Example:** Prevent notifications for ports between 3000 and 8999.

Ports won't be shown in VS Code's <Action>PORTS</Action> view or in the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) until they are opened.

```yaml
ports:
  - port: 3000-8999
    onOpen: ignore
```

## Ports ordering

Ports are ordered according to their definition in `.gitpod.yml`. Any undefined ports are sorted numerically in ascending order. Port ordering rules apply to all ports views, for example, when using `gp ports list` or viewing ports in VS Code or JetBrains.

## Port forwarding

There are two types of port forwarding: local and remote.

Local port forwarding allows you to forward a port running in your Gitpod workspace to access via your localhost hostname. Remote port forwarding exposes a locally running process to use in your workspace. Remote port forwarding is not currently supported.

### Local port forwarding

<IdeToggle id="ide-toggle-ports">

<div slot="jetbrains">
    <p>To forward a port in JetBrains, navigate to the preferences page in the <a href="/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway">JetBrains Gateway</a> client to select the port and protocol to be forwarded.</p>
    <figure>
    <img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Port forwarding in a JetBrains IDE" src="/images/jetbrains-gateway/port-forward-jetbrains.png">
        <figcaption>Port forwarding in a JetBrains IDE</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<div slot="vscodebrowser">
    <p>Using the <a href="/docs/references/ides-and-editors/local-companion">Local Companion</a>, you can automatically forward all ports from your workspace to localhost. Setting up port forwarding for VS Code Browser allows you to use a project already configured with <code>localhost</code> without requiring any code changes.</p>
</div>

<div slot="vscodedesktop">
    <p>With VS Code Desktop, all ports are automatically forwarded, allowing you to access any forwarded ports on your localhost address. You can also manually forward a port using the ports view.</p>

    <figure>
    <img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Port forwarding in VS Code Desktop" src="/images/editors/port-forwarding-vscode-desktop.png">
        <figcaption>Port forwarding in VS Code Desktop</figcaption>
    </figure>

</div>

</IdeToggle>

### Local port forwarding via SSH

Using [SSH command-line](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line) access to your workspace, ports can also be forwarded manually using tools such as the OpenSSH remote login client.

**Example:** Forwarding port `3000` to `localhost:3000`

`ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 <workspace-ssh-connection>`

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

If you start a server on a private port, let's say 5001, and want to connect to it from your web application which runs on a different port, e.g. 3000, you have to configure your requests. This is necessary because Gitpod requires credentials for private ports. Without credentials, Gitpod cannot verify that the request is made by an authorized user.

**Configure your web application**

To make this work, your web application's `fetch` request needs to have the `credentials: "include"` option set. See the [MDN doc's `credentials` description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) for more details.

**Configure your server**

In your server (the one on port 5001 in the above example), you have to configure the response to include the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header. Without it, your browser rejects the response and you see CORS errors in the browser console.

# Tasks

To get the most out of ephemeral developer environments, it is important to let Gitpod know how to build your project. We can achieve this by defining `tasks` in the [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) configuration file.

> **Note**: In your local developer environment, you likely set up your project only once. If you work in a team, you probably have written instructions on how to get started. With Gitpod, you automate these manual steps so that a new environment can be set up repeatedly by Gitpod.

Tasks are shell scripts that run on top of the Docker image you configure (learn more about [custom Docker images](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image)).

`youtube: E95oV_iqUtI`

## Execution order

With Gitpod, you have the following three types of tasks:

- `before`: Use this for tasks that need to run before `init` and before `command`. For example, customize the terminal or install global project dependencies.
- `init`: Use this for heavy-lifting tasks such as downloading dependencies or compiling source code.
- `command`: Use this to start your database or development server.

The order in which these tasks execute depends on whether you have [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) configured for your project and which startup scenario applies. Let's look at the details.

> **Caveats**
>
> - Any file changes made outside of `/workspace` file hierarchy from `init` tasks will be lost on workspace start when prebuilds are enabled. [Learn more](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds#workspace-directory-only)
> - User specific environment variables are not loaded automatically for `init` and `before` tasks but can be loaded if you want. [Learn more](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds#user-specific-environment-variables-in-prebuilds)

### Prebuild and New Workspaces

In this startup scenario, you can see how Prebuilds impact the execution order of tasks:

![Start tasks for Prebuilds & New Workspace](../../../static/images/docs/beta/configure/start-tasks/prebuilds-new-workspace-light-theme.png)
![Start tasks for Prebuilds & New Workspace](../../../static/images/docs/beta/configure/start-tasks/prebuilds-new-workspace-dark-theme.png)

The `init` task is where you want to do the heavy lifting, things like:

- Download & install dependencies
- Compile your source code
- Run your test suite
- Any other long-running, terminating processes necessary to prepare your project

As displayed in the diagram above, we highly recommend you enable Prebuilds for your project. In that case, Gitpod executes the `before` and most importantly, `init` tasks automatically for each new commit to your project.

By the time you start a new workspace, all that's left to do is execute the `before` (optional) and `command` tasks. The latter most often starts a database and/or development server.

> Let Gitpod run the time-consuming `init` tasks continuously behind the scene so you and anyone who opens your project on Gitpod doesn't have to wait.

### Restart a Workspace

When you restart a workspace, Gitpod already executed the `init` task ([see above](#prebuild-and-new-workspaces)) either as part of a Prebuild or when you started the workspace for the first time.

As part of a workspace restart, Gitpod executes the `before` and `command` tasks:

![Restart a workspace](../../../static/images/docs/beta/configure/start-tasks/restart-workspace-light-theme.png)
![Restart a workspace](../../../static/images/docs/beta/configure/start-tasks/restart-workspace-dark-theme.png)

### Start a Snapshot

When you start a snapshot, Gitpod already executed the `init` task ([see above](#prebuild-and-new-workspaces)) either as part of a Prebuild or when you or a team member started the snapshot's initial workspace for the first time.

As part of starting a snapshot, Gitpod executes the `before` and `command` tasks:

![Start a snapshot](../../../static/images/docs/beta/configure/start-tasks/start-snapshot-light-theme.png)
![Start a snapshot](../../../static/images/docs/beta/configure/start-tasks/start-snapshot-dark-theme.png)

## Configure the terminal

You can configure where terminals open using the `openMode` properties below.
Please note that this information is used if no previous terminals in the layout exist.
Snapshots will first try to reuse existing terminals in the layout, before opening new ones.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Static Server
    command: python3 -m http.server 8080
  - name: DB Server
    command: sh ./scripts/start-db.sh
    openMode: split-right
```

### openMode

You can configure how the terminal should be opened relative to the previous task.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| openMode                 | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openMode: tab-after`    | Opens in the same tab group right after the previous tab   |
| `openMode: tab-before`   | Opens in the same tab group left before the previous tab   |
| `openMode: split-right`  | Splits and adds the terminal to the right                  |
| `openMode: split-left`   | Splits and adds the terminal to the left                   |
| `openMode: split-top`    | **Deprecated**. Splits and adds the terminal to the top    |
| `openMode: split-bottom` | **Deprecated**. Splits and adds the terminal to the bottom |

</div>

## Example Tasks

The examples below are common use cases you can get inspired by and adjust for your project's needs.

> **Note**: `before` and `init` tasks need to terminate while `command` can run indefinitely (i.e. until cancelled with Ctrl + C). This is because `before` and `init` may run as part of a prebuild and if these tasks do not terminate, the prebuild will eventually fail with a timeout.

### One-line tasks

Each task contains a single `npm` command. The `init` task terminates once the dependencies are installed while the `command` task starts a development server and does not terminate.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Dev Server
    init: npm install
    command: npm run dev
```

### Multi-line tasks

To run multiple commands for a given task, you can use the `|` notation where each line below (make sure you indent correctly) runs in sequence once the previous command terminates.

In the following example, the `init` task installs dependencies and configures a database. Then, the `command` task starts the dev server(s).

> **Note**: In case of multiple terminals, there is no guarantee on the order in which tasks execute. The only guarantee you have is that `before`, `init` and `command` execute in that sequence **per terminal**.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Dependencies & Database
    init: |
      npm install
      npm run configure-database
    command: npm run dev
```

> **Note**: This doesn't stop execution on errors. If `npm install` in the example above fails, the `npm run configure-database` will still run. See [how to exit after failure](#immediately-exit-for-any-command-failure-within-a-task) below for a workaround.

### Wait for commands to complete

When working with multiple terminals, you may have a situation where terminal 1 runs build scripts and terminal 2 and 3 require that these scripts complete first. This can be achieved with [`gp sync-await`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#sync-await) and [`gp sync-done`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#sync-done).

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Rails
    init: >
      bundle install &&
      yarn install --check-files &&
      rails db:setup &&
      gp sync-done bundle # 'bundle' is an arbitrary name
    command: rails server

  - name: Webpack
    init: gp sync-await bundle # wait for the above 'init' to finish
    command: bin/webpack-dev-server

  - name: Redis
    init: gp sync-await bundle
    command: redis-server

  - name: Sidekiq
    init: gp sync-await bundle
    command: sidekiq
```

### Wait for a port to be available

Let's say you have a web app dev server that takes a moment to start up to listen on port 3000. Once it's up and running, you want to run end-to-end tests against `http://localhost:3000`.

You can achieve this with two terminals and the `gp ports await` CLI command.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Dev Server
    init: npm install
    command: npm run dev

  - name: e2e Tests
    command: |
      gp ports await 3000
      npm run test
```

### Immediately exit for any command failure within a task

If you wish to halt an entire task with for an error within the task script, then you could do the following:

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: |
      (
        set -e # Tells bash to immediately exit on failure off a command
        bundle install
        yarn install --frozen-lockfile
        bundle exec rake
        bundle exec nanoc compile
      )
```

Gitpod starts all your `tasks` inside separate `bash` (`$SHELL`) shells. Gitpod can only assert the exit status of the shell process of a task. Normally `bash` or other shells don't halt on a failure of a command unless you explicitly ask it to. `bash` only inherits the last exit status of a script run with it before it's own `exit`. Hence Gitpod can't determine if all of your commands inside the `init` task succeeded. To have that effect, you can put `set -e;` on top of task shell-commands and wrap your whole task-script with `()` to configure that particular task shell to halt and immediately exit with an error code for a failure of any command. This can be specially helpful for prebuilds (i.e `init` tasks)

# Workspace classes

Workspace classes allow you to select the resources available to your workspaces.

On gitpod.io, the options are:

- **Standard**: up to 4 cores, up to 8GB RAM, 30GB storage
- **Large**: up to 8 cores, up to 16GB RAM, 50GB storage

You can override the default (Standard) workspace class in the [Gitpod project](/docs/configure/projects) settings for your repository.

![Project Settings](../../../static/images/docs/project-settings.png)

## Select a workspace class for your workspace

You can select workspace class directly from [Gitpod Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). You can do that from by clicking on the `New Workspace` button. Then, you can select the [context url](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url) and [Editor](/docs/references/ides-and-editors).

## Good to know

- Large workspace classes use [credits](/docs/configure/billing#credits) at a faster rate. Standard workspaces use 10 credits per hour, whereas Large workspaces use 20 credits per hour.
- [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) currently use the same workspace class as regular workspaces.

# Workspace Image

By default, Gitpod uses a standard Docker Image called [`Workspace-Full`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/481f7600b725e0ab507fbf8377641a562a475625/dazzle.yaml#L18) as the foundation for workspaces. Workspaces started based on this default image come pre-installed with Docker, Nix, Go, Java, Node.js, C/C++, Python, Ruby, Rust, Clojure as well as tools such as Homebrew, Tailscale, Nginx and several more.

If this image does not include the tools you need for your project, you can provide a public Docker image or your own [Dockerfile](#configure-a-custom-dockerfile). This provides you with the flexibility to install the tools & libraries required for your project.

> **Note:** Gitpod supports Debian/Ubuntu based Docker images. Alpine images do not include [libgcc and libstdc++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/linux#_tips-by-linux-distribution) which breaks Visual Studio Code. See also [Issue #3356](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/3356).

## Use a public Docker image

You can define a public Docker image in your `.gitpod.yml` file with the following configuration:

```yaml
image: node:buster
```

The official Gitpod Docker images are hosted on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/gitpod/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>.

You can find the source code for these images in <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>.

### Docker image tags

For public images, feel free to specify a tag, e.g. `image: node:buster` if you are interested in a particular version of the Docker image.

For Gitpod images, we recommend using timestamped tag for maximum reproducibility, for example `image: gitpod/workspace-full:2022-05-08-14-31-53` (taken from the `Tags` panel on [this dockerhub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full/tags) for example)

## Use a private Docker image

> This is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle).

You may also use private Docker images.

To do so you must provide the registry authentication details to Gitpod by setting `GITPOD_IMAGE_AUTH` with the following value `<registry-domain>:<base64-encoded 'username:password'>` as a [Project-level environment variable](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#project-specific-environment-variables).

For example, if the registry is `docker.io`, the username is `foo` and the password is `bar`, the `GITPOD_IMAGE_AUTH` environment variable value may be calculated using the command `echo -n "docker.io:"; echo -n "foo:bar" | base64 -w0` which outputs `docker.io:Zm9vOmJhcg==`.

## Use a custom Dockerfile

This option provides you with the most flexibility. Start by adding the following configuration in your `.gitpod.yml` file:

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

Next, create a `.gitpod.Dockerfile` file at the root of your project. The syntax is the regular `Dockerfile` syntax as <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" target="_blank">documented on docs.docker.com</a>.

A good starting point for creating a custom `.gitpod.Dockerfile` is the
<a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/481f7600b725e0ab507fbf8377641a562a475625/dazzle.yaml#L18" target="_blank">gitpod/workspace-full</a> image as it already contains all the tools necessary to work with all languages Gitpod supports.

```dockerfile
# You can find the new timestamped tags here: https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full/tags
FROM gitpod/workspace-full:2022-05-08-14-31-53

# Install custom tools, runtime, etc.
RUN brew install fzf
```

> ⚠️ **Caveat:** > `COPY` instructions in a Dockerfile is only evaluated once and then cached.
> [See this](#manually-rebuild-a-workspace-image) to break the cache and trigger a rebuild.

> ⚠️ **Caveat:** The base image of a custom Dockerfile must be public.

**Docker support**: If you use the `gitpod/workspace-full` image, you get Docker support built-in to your environment.

If you want a base image without the default tooling installed then use the <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/481f7600b725e0ab507fbf8377641a562a475625/dazzle.yaml#L3" target="_blank">gitpod/workspace-base</a> image.

```dockerfile
# You can find the new timestamped tags here: https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-base/tags
FROM gitpod/workspace-base:2022-05-08-14-31-53

# Install custom tools, runtime, etc.
# base image only got `apt` as the package manager
# install-packages is a wrapper for `apt` that helps skip a few commands in the docker env.
RUN sudo install-packages shellcheck tree llvm
```

When you launch a Gitpod workspace, the local console will use the `gitpod` user, so all local settings, config file, etc. should apply to `/home/gitpod` or be run using `USER gitpod` (we no longer recommend using `USER root`).

You can however use `sudo` in your Dockerfile. The following example shows a typical `.gitpod.Dockerfile` inheriting from `gitpod/workspace-full`:

```dockerfile
# You can find the new timestamped tags here: https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full/tags
FROM gitpod/workspace-full:2022-05-08-14-31-53

# Install custom tools, runtime, etc.
# install-packages is a wrapper for `apt` that helps skip a few commands in the docker env.
RUN sudo install-packages \
          binwalk \
          clang \
          tmux

# Apply user-specific settings
```

Once committed and pushed, Gitpod will automatically build this Dockerfile when (or [before](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds)) new workspaces are created.

See also [Gero's blog post](/blog/docker-in-gitpod) running through an example.

### Custom base image

While it is recommended to extend one of the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/gitpod/" target="_blank">Gitpod-provided base images</a> for custom Dockerfiles to ensure the image has the required dependencies for a workspace, it is possible to configure a Dockerfile with a public (Debian/Ubuntu-based) image as its base.

There are some requirements though for a public base image to work properly as a workspace. See the below Dockerfile as a reference. For instance, you'll need to set up the `gitpod` user with the right UID, and install `git` to enable your configured dotfiles for the workspace.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install:
# - git (and git-lfs), for git operations (to e.g. push your work).
#   Also required for setting up your configured dotfiles in the workspace.
# - sudo, while not required, is recommended to be installed, since the
#   workspace user (`gitpod`) is non-root and won't be able to install
#   and use `sudo` to install any other tools in a live workspace.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -yq \
    git \
    git-lfs \
    sudo \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/*

# Create the gitpod user. UID must be 33333.
RUN useradd -l -u 33333 -G sudo -md /home/gitpod -s /bin/bash -p gitpod gitpod

USER gitpod
```

**Additional tools & languages:** see https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/tree/main/chunks for references to configure your workspace image with common tools and languages. For instance, [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/main/chunks/tool-docker/Dockerfile) shows how to install `docker` and `docker-compose`.

**Tailscale:** see [the Tailscale integration docs](/docs/integrations/tailscale#integration) for setting up Tailscale in a custom Dockerfile.

## Trying out changes to your Dockerfile

### In the existing workspace

> `gp rebuild` is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7671).

To test your custom `.gitpod.Dockerfile`, run the following command:

```bash
gp rebuild
```

This builds a new image from your workspace, spins up a container and connects to it. Once connected, you can confirm all necessary tools and libraries are installed in the container. Finally, type `exit` to disconnect and return to your Gitpod workspace.

### As a new workspace

Once you validated the `.gitpod.Dockerfile` with the approach described in the previous chapter, it is time to start a new Gitpod workspace based on that custom image.

The easiest way to try out your changes is as follows:

1. Create a new branch.
1. Commit your changes & push the branch to your git hosting server.
1. Open a pull / merge request and open it in your browser.
1. Prefix the URL with `gitpod.io/#` and hit Enter.

This starts a new workspace with your changes applied. You notice you now have two Gitpod workspaces running. The one where you made the changes and the new one, based on the pull request.

**Caution**: Keeping the first workspace open is important in case your Dockerfile has bugs and prevents Gitpod from starting a workspace based on your pull request.

In the second workspace, the Docker build will start and show the output. If your Dockerfile has issues and the build fails or the resulting workspace does not look like you expected, you can force push changes to your config using your first, still running workspace and simply start a fresh workspace again to try them out.

We are working on allowing Docker builds directly from within workspaces, but until then this approach has been proven to be the most productive.

## Manually rebuild a workspace image

Sometimes you find yourself in situations where you want to manually rebuild a workspace image, for example if packages you rely on released a security fix.

You can trigger a workspace image rebuild with the following URL pattern: `https://gitpod.io/#imagebuild/<your-repo-url>`.

## Configure a custom shell

> **Feedback needed**: Custom shell support is in the works. The below shows a method for running some of the `~/.bashrc.d` startup scripts. To leave feedback on the approach, please see this GitHub issue: [#10105](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/10105).

For example, if you wish to default your workspace-image to `zsh`, you could do it from your [custom dockerfile](#custom-docker-image) with the following line:

```dockerfile
ENV SHELL=/usr/bin/zsh
```

Tip: You could also create an environment variable at https://gitpod.io/variables called `SHELL` with `*/*` scope for setting a personal default SHELL.

Caveat: Shells like `fish`, `zsh` and etc. are not POSIX-compliant or bash-compatible, so your Gitpod tasks might error if you use some POSIX or bash specific features in your task scripts.

### Load bash environment in custom shell

Currently we put some startup scripts for the workspace-images at `~/.bashrc.d`, that means if you change your SHELL from `bash` to something else, they will not auto run. You could run the following command from your SHELL to workaround:

```bash
bash -lic 'true'
```

## FAQs

### [Why is my custom dockerfile rebuild everytime even with no change made to it?](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1069452552111923280)
<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

This usually happens when you don't pin the image tag (AKA version) inside your [custom dockerfile](#use-a-custom-dockerfile).

In such casues, it could be that there has been long gaps between the time you reuse a workspace or create a new one. We usually release new images every week so if there was more than one week between each start then the image will be rebuild every time.

So, for example, if your `.gitpod.Dockerfile` looks like the following:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full:latest

# ... more stuff
```

You could grab a timestamped tag from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full/tags) for `gitpod/workspace-full`.

And then your `.gitpod.Dockerfile` could look like:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full:2023-01-16-03-31-28

# ... more stuff
```

Note: Please grab a recent tag from the linked page, don't copy paste the example from here.

Also see [docker-image-tags](#docker-image-tags) for more info.

<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

If you wish to do GUI application development in Gitpod and getting errors such as:

- Unable to init server: Could not connect : Connection refused
- No display server running
- Xorg missing
- `xdg-open` command not found

Then you need to use the `gitpod/workspace-full-vnc` docker image. See [this page](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/axonasif/add_docs/chunks/tool-vnc/README.md#details) for more info.

</script>

# Workspace Lifecycle

Gitpod brings a new way to think about your development environment. Rather than a single local environment that you keep up-to-date, with Gitpod you can have as many [workspaces](/docs/configure/workspaces) as you need.

## Workspace Statuses

The state of the workspace is indicated by the color of the workspace indicator. For example, in the Gitpod [dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces), workspace state is shown on the workspace list.

1. 🟠 **Starting** - Workspace provisioning, inaccessible to the user.
2. 🟢 **Running** - Workspace loaded, accessible to the user.
3. 🟠 **Stopping** - Workspace being stopped, backups performing.
4. 🔴 **Stopped** - Workspace no longer accessible. File system preserved for restart.

> **Important:** Only files in the `/workspace` directory are kept between state transitions.

The following describes each workspace status in detail, including what can cause a workspace to transition from one status to another.

### Workspace Starting

When you open a workspace, it will be in the "starting" state. This means that the workspace is being created and the initialization process is running.

- Where a workspace is being provisioned and initialized.
- If configured and available, a prebuild snapshot is used.
- Otherwise, source control is downloaded into the workspace.

### Workspace Running

- An active workspace is provisioned within Gitpod.
- The workspace can be accessed by the user.

### Workspace Stopped

- No provisioned workspace is running (e.g. ports and URLs are not accessible).
- Only files and directories inside `/workspace` are preserved.
- If the workspace is restarted, the URL is preserved.
- A start is required before the workspace can be used.

### Workspace Deleted

Workspaces are deleted after 14 days. Pinned workspaces are never deleted automatically.

## Workspace Actions

### Workspace Pinning

A pinned workspace is never deleted. You can pin a workspace from your [workspace list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) in the Gitpod dashboard.

### Workspace Snapshotting

You can create a snapshot of a workspace to save its state. This is useful if you want to keep a workspace around for a longer period of time, than the default. Read more about [Snapshots](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration).

## Workspace Deletion

Stopped workspaces are automatically deleted 14 days since the last workspace start. Pinned workspaces are never deleted. You can pin a workspace from your [workspace list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) in the Gitpod dashboard.

## Workspace Timeouts

Running workspaces will stop automatically after a period of inactivity.

### Workspace Inactivity

By default, workspaces stop following 30 minutes without user input (e.g. keystrokes or terminal input commands). You can increase the workspace timeout up to a maximum of 24 hours.

### Editor Disconnect

Currently, all timeouts are dependent on an active editor connection. Closing your Gitpod connected editor or IDE will reduce the workspace timeout to 5 minutes.

### Extending Timeouts

Paying users of Gitpod can extend the inactivity timeout of their current workspace using the `gp timeout set` from the [Gitpod CLI](/docs/references/gitpod-cli), which is installed in all gitpod workspaces by default. Extending the workspace timeout does not affect the inactivity timeout of other any other workspaces.

# Contribute Features & Patches

Gitpod is developed as an open core product under an [OSI-approved open source license](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod), making the majority of functionality freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. As is typical with open core enterprise features are developed under a non OSI-approved license. Where contributions are not trivial ("de minimis") Gitpod requires contributors to sign a contributors license agreement before we will be able to merge your contribution.

Gitpodders have built-in the open for the last decade. Transparency is key and as a company Gitpod strives to be as open about as many things as possible. This refers to both developing Gitpod in the open (public issues, public roadmap, public milestones) as well as how employees interact on a personal level with other human beings. Gitpodders are strong believers in the benefits that an open culture provides. At Gitpod we are open-minded, inclusive, transparent, and curious. We always remain students of the game, not masters of the game.

# Troubleshooting

If you cannot find your issue here or in the documentation, please contact Gitpod via our [Support page](/support).

## Gitpod logs in VS Code Browser and Desktop

These logs contain information about the workspace, the session, and the Visual Studio Code environment. They are useful for diagnosing connection issues and other unexpected behavior.

- Open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette (<Keybind>CtrlCmd + Shift + P</Keybind>) and type **Export logs**, select **Gitpod: Export all logs** from the list to download a zip file containing all of the logs.

**Important:** The content of these logs should **NOT** be shared publicly as they could contain sensitive information about your workspace. Instead, send them to troubleshooting@gitpod.io along with a link to a corresponding GitHub issue if needed.

## Gitpod logs in JetBrains Gateway

These logs contain information about the workspace, the session, and the JetBrains Gateway. They are useful for diagnosing issues when connecting to a workspace, issues from Gateway Plugins and issues preventing the JetBrains Client to open.

- Open the **Help** menu and select **Collect Logs and Diagnostic Data** option. After a few seconds, the file manager window will show up, revealing the location where the zip file containing all the logs has been saved.

**Important:** The content of these logs should **NOT** be shared publicly as they could contain sensitive information about your workspace. Instead, send them to troubleshooting@gitpod.io along with a link to a corresponding GitHub issue if needed.

**Note:** Ensure you are using the latest version of [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway) and [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway), as issues from older versions might have already been fixed.

## Gitpod logs in JetBrains Client

These logs contain information about the workspace, the session, and the JetBrains IDE. They are useful for diagnosing connection issues, issues from IDE Plugins, and any unexpected behavior from the client and the server.

- Open the **Help** menu and select **Collect Host and Client logs** option. After a few seconds, the file manager window will show up, revealing the location where the zip file containing all the logs has been saved.

**Important:** The content of these logs should **NOT** be shared publicly as they could contain sensitive information about your workspace. Instead, send them to troubleshooting@gitpod.io along with a link to a corresponding GitHub issue if needed.

**Note:** Ensure you are using the latest version of both [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway) and [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway), as issues from older versions might have already been fixed.

## Why doesn't the "ClearURLs" browser extension work with Gitpod?

The ClearURLs browser extension for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearurls/lckanjgmijmafbedllaakclkaicjfmnk?hl=en) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/) inhibits Gitpod workspaces from initialising and the problem manifests with the following symptoms:

- The dark theme doesn't load
- The bottom left Gitpod button is missing
- The VS Code Marketplace does not load
- Settings Sync does not work

This issue can be resolved by disabling "ETag filtering" in ClearURLs’ settings. An [issue has been created](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls/-/issues/977) that requests to whitelist Gitpod by default and we would appreciate your upvotes on the issue.

## What should I do if JetBrains Gateway and Gitpod aren't working?

1. Ensure you are using the latest version of [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway)
2. Ensure you are using the latest version of the [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway)

## What can I do if I have unsynced data inside a workspace but it's not starting?

While this is a very critical issue, our workspace-team would eventually look into why it's happening but on the other hand you might not be able to wait while things get fixed. As an user you can try and get your workspace data yourself:

1. Go to the [Gitpod Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces)
2. Find your workspace from the list
3. Download your workspace like so:
   ![Download a workspace](../../../static/images/docs/troubleshooting/download_a_workspace.png)
4. You can now either try opening a new workspace or use your local machine for a while.
5. The downloaded workspace is a `tar` file which can be extracted with `tar -xf <your-workspace-filename-here>` command on a new Gitpod workspace or in your Linux/MacOS machine. You can use `7-zip` to extract if you're on windows and don't have `tar`.

# JetBrains Gateway

> {title} is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

[JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/) is your single entry point to all remote development environments when using JetBrains IDE's. JetBrains Gateway is a compact desktop app that allows you to work remotely with a JetBrains IDE without downloading the full IDE. Gitpod works with JetBrains Gateway via a custom Gitpod [JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway).

Using JetBrains Gateway on Desktop with Gitpod, allows you to:

1. Create a new Gitpod workspace
2. View and open your 20 latest Gitpod workspaces

All without leaving needing to leave your desktop.

## JetBrains IDE support

JetBrains Gateway is the underlying technology which enables the Gitpod integration. Support for JetBrains IDEs will be rolled out incrementally. The [JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) is a standalone feature, so its release cycle is independent individual JetBrains IDE support.

## Getting started

`youtube: 8djaRYT2FAY`

1. **Install [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-a.html#gateway)** - With the [JetBrains Gateway and Gitpod](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) plugin you can create and manage your latest 20 Gitpod workspaces.
2. **Install the Gitpod plugin** - Open JetBrains Gateway and you'll see the Gitpod logo on the main page. Click "install" to install the [Gitpod plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) for JetBrains Gateway.
3. **Update your Gitpod preferences** - Select your preferred JetBrains IDE on the [Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences) which will set your default IDE for future workspace starts.
4. **Start (or restart) your workspace** - Either start a workspace directly from within the [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) via the Gitpod plugin **OR** open a new workspace directly in Gitpod where on workspace start you will be prompted to open your preferred JetBrains IDE for that workspace.

### How does JetBrains and Gitpod work?

On Gitpod workspace start, a JetBrains IDE is loaded into your workspace according to your preferences. When you start a workspace the JetBrains Gateway application downloads a thin client which then connects to your Gitpod workspace.

Since [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/) downloads the thin client for you, **you do not need to download, open or modify your JetBrains IDE directly**. JetBrains licensing still applies, but is applied to the connecting thin client, not the backend running in your Gitpod workspace.

### Setting a JetBrains IDE as a preference

To start a workspace using JetBrains from your browser, you need to first set your preferred JetBrains IDE as your user preference.

    <figcaption>Updating Gitpod IDE preferences to a JetBrains IDE</figcaption>
</figure>

### Opening a JetBrains IDE from Gitpod

When starting a new workspace from Gitpod in the browser (with a JetBrains IDE set as your preference) you will see a prompt to open JetBrains Gateway. Clicking the prompt will immediately launch JetBrains Gateway and begin downloading the IDE thin client. The downloaded thin client will exactly match the IDE running in your Gitpod workspace.

    <figcaption>Opening JetBrains Gateway from Gitpod</figcaption>
</figure>

### Updating the Gitpod plugin in JetBrains Gateway

Since Gitpod and JetBrains works via JetBrains Gateway, you do not need to download a JetBrains IDE. Also, **you do not need to alter your plugin settings in your JetBrains IDE**. All setup and configuration for Gitpod and JetBrains is completed within JetBrains Gateway.

<figure>

    <figcaption>Updating the Gitpod plugin in JetBrains Gateway</figcaption>
</figure>

### Opening a JetBrains IDE from JetBrains Gateway

You can also start, and connect to Gitpod workspaces directly from JetBrains Gateway. Click Gitpod in the left-hand side of JetBrains Gateway, and paste a source control context URL directly to start a new workspace, or click connect on a running or stopped workspace.

    <figcaption>Opening a JetBrains IDE from Gateway</figcaption>
</figure>

## Configuring the JetBrains Gateway Host

By default the JetBrains Gateway Gitpod plugin points to `gitpod.io` as the default host for listing, opening and managing Gitpod workspaces.

If you're using Gitpod [Self-Hosted](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest), to update the host:

1. Open JetBrains Gateway
2. Navigate to "preferences" (OSX) or "settings" (Windows/Linux)
3. Search for "Gitpod" (or find it under "tools")
4. Modify the `Gitpod Host` field

    <figcaption>Setting the Gitpod host in the JetBrains Gateway plugin (OSX)</figcaption>
</figure>

## Configuring JetBrains Gateway Networking

The following diagram details how the JetBrains Gateway client connects and communicates with Gitpod workspaces, for situations such as configuring corporate networking requirements.

1. **JetBrains.com** - The JetBrains IDE thin client images are downloaded dynamically from JetBrains Gateway to match the exact IDE that is running in Gitpod. Access to jetbrains.com must be granted for an air-gapped Gitpod installation with JetBrains Gateway configuration to work.
2. **JetBrains Gateway** - The JetBrains Gateway client is the component which fetches information about Gitpod workspaces, pulled from the Gitpod API via HTTPS.
3. **JetBrains Thin Client** - The thin client connects to the Gitpod workspace via SSH, routed via the workspace proxy ("ws-proxy"). The SSH server (SSH Gateway) runs in the workspace proxy, not in the workspace directly.

# Tailscale

With Tailscale you can automatically and securely connect your Gitpod workspace to other development resources, whether in the cloud or on prem, such as a production database behind your company’s firewall. You can also spin up several Gitpod workspaces that can talk to each other.

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is built on top of the point-to-point open-source [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) protocol which powers an encrypted mesh network or `tailnet`. At Gitpod we are big fans of their product and recently announced an [official partnership](/blog/tailscale) with them.

## Integration

> **Note:** Using [Tailscale ssh](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh/) _to_ a workspace is not supported right now and _from_ requires Tailscale 1.32 or later. If your workspace image was created before 1.32 was available you can [force](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#manually-rebuild-a-workspace-image) a rebuild without having to update your `.gitpod.Dockerfile`.

If you’re already using Tailscale, the following steps need to be done (see https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-tailscale-with-gitpod for a working example):

1. Install `tailscale` through a custom `.gitpod.Dockerfile` by adding the following layer to it.

```Dockerfile
USER root

# Install jq (if not done already). Required for the .gitpod.yml tasks below.

RUN curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.gpg | sudo apt-key add - \
     && curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list \
     && apt-get update \
     && apt-get install -y tailscale jq \
     && update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-nft
```

2. Start `tailscale` on workspace start and maintain the machine state across workspaces by adding the following tasks to your `.gitpod.yml`.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: tailscaled
    command: |
      if [ -n "${TAILSCALE_STATE_MYPROJECT}" ]; then
        # restore the tailscale state from gitpod user's env vars
        sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tailscale
        echo "${TAILSCALE_STATE_MYPROJECT}" | sudo tee /var/lib/tailscale/tailscaled.state > /dev/null
      fi
      sudo tailscaled
  - name: tailscale
    command: |
      if [ -n "${TAILSCALE_STATE_MYPROJECT}" ]; then
        sudo -E tailscale up
      else
        sudo -E tailscale up --hostname "gitpod-${GITPOD_GIT_USER_NAME// /-}-$(echo ${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CONTEXT} | jq -r .repository.name)"
        # store the tailscale state into gitpod user
        gp env TAILSCALE_STATE_MYPROJECT="$(sudo cat /var/lib/tailscale/tailscaled.state)"
      fi
```

This configuration will register a Tailscale node based on the following name scheme: `gitpod-{user-name}-{repo-name}`. On first workspace start you will get asked to login through the terminal. When this was successful a Tailscale machine state will be stored in your Gitpod's account. On subsequent starts of workspaces on this project this machine state will be restored.

IF you enable [Tailscale's Magic DNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/) you get a stable domain for your project's services that you can reach from any other Tailscale node (e.g. another workspace or your local machine).

> **Warning:** Be aware that starting and connecting multiple workspaces for the same project in parallel results in unreliable network connections.

# Getting started

Gitpod can provide fully initialized, perfectly set-up developer environments for any kind of software project. This page helps you understand how to provide such a configuration for _your project_.
`youtube: ij1msCffQZA`

## Start your first workspace

The best way to configure Gitpod is by using Gitpod - you could perform the following steps in your local environment as well, but we may as well experience ephemeral developer environments right from the beginning.

1. In a browser, navigate to your project's GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket page.
2. In the browser's address bar, prefix the entire URL with `gitpod.io/#` and press Enter.
   - For example, `gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website`
   - We recommend you [install the Gitpod browser extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension) to make this a one-click operation.
3. Sign in with one of the listed providers and let the workspace start up.

**Congratulations**, you have started your first of many ephemeral developer environments 🎉!

> 💡 **You can also start a Gitpod workspace with more options**. [_Learn more_](/docs/references/ides-and-editors#start-a-workspace-with-an-ideeditor)

## Open in Gitpod button

You can add the following button to your Development/Setup Docs so that users can launch projects in Gitpod and begin working on them without having to go through the entire setup process.

<img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg" alt="Open with Gitpod"/>

```markdown
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#<your-repository-url>)
```

> here, `your-repository-url` can be something like: `https://github.com/gitpod-samples/awesome-gitpod` or any of your Repository URLs.

### Contribute with Gitpod badge

To make it easy for anyone to start a Gitpod workspace based on your project, we recommend you add a badge to your `README.md`.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Contribute%20with-Gitpod-908a85?logo=gitpod" alt="Contribute with Gitpod"/>

```html
<a href="https://gitpod.io/#<your-repository-url>">

    src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Contribute%20with-Gitpod-908a85?logo=gitpod"
    alt="Contribute with Gitpod"
  />
</a>
```

Next, let's help Gitpod understand your repository to automate the developer environment and turn on prebuilds to supercharge your development workflow.

## Help Gitpod understand your repository

When you started your first workspace above, Gitpod didn't do much. In fact, all it did was start the workspace and `git clone` your source code.
To develop, you still would have to install dependencies, run build scripts and start the development server every time you start a workspace... We can do better, so let's automate that!

1. In the workspace terminal, make sure you are in your project's root directory (`pwd` should be `/workspace/<repo>`).
1. Run `gp init` to generate a scaffold `.gitpod.yml` configuration file (see the [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for all configuration options).
1. Open the newly created `.gitpod.yml` file.

### Init script

Most projects require some sort of initialization script to download and install dependencies, compile the source code, etc. For example, a Node.js project requires `npm install`. The `init` task by default reads `echo 'init script'`, let's replace that with your project-specific init command, for example:

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: npm install
    command: echo 'start script'
```

Excellent! To learn more about the difference between `init` and `command`, please have a look at [Start Tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks).

### Command script

Next, let's adjust the `command` script. This is the script Gitpod executes when the workspace successfully started up. In most cases, this is where you start your application's development server, e.g. `npm run dev`.

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: npm install
    command: npm run dev
```

### Configure your app's ports

If your application starts a development server that listens on a certain port, we can let Gitpod know how to deal with that. To get started, update the `port` according to what your application listens on, e.g. `3000`.

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: npm install
    command: npm run dev
ports:
  - port: 3000
    onOpen: open-preview
```

When Gitpod notices port 3000 is available, it automatically opens your application in a preview to the right of your editor - ready for you to develop and see your changes.

### Commit `.gitpod.yml`

Lastly, make sure to commit the `.gitpod.yml` configuration file to Git and push it to your repository.

## Start your second workspace

Once you committed and pushed `.gitpod.yml`, **open a new browser tab** and navigate to your project's page on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket.

> If you pushed to a branch, please make sure you switch to that branch before you continue.

1. Open a new workspace (see [Start your first workspace](#start-your-first-workspace) above).
1. Observe how Gitpod automatically runs the tasks you configured.
1. Wait until the development server started and your application's preview is displayed on the right side of the editor.

If for some reason the second workspace does not start, simply close the tab and navigate back to the first workspace. Fix the errors that caused the workspace to fail based on the error output you see, commit and push your changes and start yet another workspace to test the latest changes.

Congratulations, again 😊! You now have a basic Gitpod configuration and for each new workspace you start, Gitpod automatically runs the scripts you manually have to run locally.

## Shut down your workspaces

This is easy - close the workspace browser tabs.

Within three minutes, the workspaces will be stopped. You can always find them at https://gitpod.io/workspaces - to be honest though, you can forget about them and start a new workspace the next time you work on your project.

## Supercharge your experience with prebuilds

The automation you have experienced so far is nice, but there's more! Remember that `init` task we [configured earlier](#init-script)?

You may have wondered why there are separate `init` and `command` tasks. This is because we can tell Gitpod to **run the `init` script every time new code is pushed to your project**. By the time you or one of your organization members starts a new workspace, the `init` task already finished and you don't have to wait for that - saving you precious time. We call this **prebuilds**.

### An intro to prebuilds

Let's first look at an example and then configure your project to take advantage of prebuilds.

Imagine this common workflow where Nina and Paul work on the same project:

1. Nina opens a pull request where she developed a feature that requires a new dependency.
1. _Gitpod notices the new code and kicks off a prebuild by cloning the source code and executing the `init` task. The result is saved as a prebuilt workspace._
1. Some time later, Paul opens the pull request to start his code review.
1. He opens a Gitpod workspace for that given pull request (learn more about [contexts](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url)).
1. _Gitpod recognizes it already ran the `init` task and loads the prebuilt workspace_
1. By the time the workspace starts, Paul sees the development server starting up and the application's preview is ready for review.

For each new commit to your project, Gitpod continuously creates prebuilt workspaces so that the project is always ready-to-code. If your project is open source, anyone gets to enjoy the efficiency of prebuilds regardless of whether they are part of your organization or not.

### Configure prebuilds for your projects

Depending on your Git provider, the steps to configure prebuilds vary slightly. Please refer to the dedicated [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) page for detailed instructions on how to configure prebuilds for your project.

## Next steps

At this point, you have a `.gitpod.yml` configuration file to automate repetitive tasks and prebuilds configured to let Gitpod execute many of these tasks continuously whenever new code is pushed to your project - freeing you from waiting to download, install & build your project and its dependencies.

To explore more of what Gitpod has to offer, we recommend the following next topics:

- [Configure](/docs/configure) to learn more about start tasks, environment variables and how to provide your own custom Docker image as the foundation for workspaces.
- [Develop](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod) to learn more about the productivity gains you get with ephemeral workspaces, how contexts assist you and how to collaborate with organization members.

# Agda Quickstart

Learn how to set-up and understand the benefits of Gitpod **in less than 5 min** with our [Agda](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-agda) template.

The following guide will:

- Walk you through a real world example with an existing Gitpod config
- Introduce you to prebuilds
- Demonstrate the benefits of ephemeral developer environments

For simplicity we use a GitHub template, but Gitpod works similarly with GitLab and Bitbucket.

## Step 1: Clone Git repository

- Create a new repository based on the [Agda template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-agda/generate).
- Name it e.g. `my-agda-template`.

## Step 2: Install the Gitpod app

- Install the [Gitpod App](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io/installations/new).

  Gitpod's GitHub app is similar to a CI server and will continuously prepare prebuilds for all your branches and pull requests - so you don't have to wait for Maven or NPM downloading the internet when you want to start coding.

## Step 3: First prebuild

- Start your first workspace with a prebuild by prefixing **https://gitpod.io#prebuild/** to the URL of the repository.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/<my-agda-template>`

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the `init` commands in the _.gitpod.yml_ file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information see [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).

## Step 4: Enjoy being ready-to-code 🤙

Once the first prebuild ran, Gitpod starts an automated and fully configured developer environment in a workspace that is now ready for you to develop.

Other developers made their setup even more productive and supercharged their workflows with the following quick steps:

1. **Installing the browser extension**

You can install the Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

The extension simply adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitHub, and Bitbucket that prefixes the URL with `gitpod.io/#` so that you can easily open a new workspace from any Git context.

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

If you prefer to not install browser extensions then you can use the Gitpod [browser bookmarklet](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-bookmarklet) instead.

For our partner GitLab we have a native integration into their UI that you can enable here.

2. **Add your favorite VS Code themes and extensions**

You have access to all Visual Studio Code extensions published under the vendor neutral [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/). Install one by clicking the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and enter your favorite theme or VS Code extension.

Changes you make in your workspace such as themes and extensions are synced automatically to other workspaces.

3. **Start throwing away workspaces like paper towels**

You can now start to treat dev environments as automated resources you spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Dev environments become fully ephemeral.

You even can start switching between workspaces or open several workspaces on the same context - two for your feature, one for reviewing a PR/MR, one for a bug, one for another MR/PR.

Try it out and open 3 workspaces on the same context (e.g. on main or on an issue). 🤓

## Next Steps

You've successfully ran your first workspace and experienced first hand what we mean with ephemeral dev environments. This is just the first step on your journey towards being always ready to code. Helpful resources from here are:

You even can start switching between workspaces or open several workspaces on the same context - two for your feature, one for reviewing a PR/MR, one for a bug, one for another MR/PR.

Try it out and open 3 workspaces on the same context (e.g. on main or on an issue). 🤓

# C++ CMake Quickstart

Learn how to set-up and understand the benefits of Gitpod **in less than 5 min** with our [C++ CMake](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-cpp) template.

The following guide will:

- Walk you through a real world example with an existing Gitpod config
- Introduce you to prebuilds
- Demonstrate the benefits of ephemeral developer environments

For simplicity we use a GitHub template, but Gitpod works similarly with GitLab and Bitbucket.

### Step 1: Clone Git repository

- Create a new repository based on the [C template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-cpp/generate).
- Name it e.g. `my-cpp-template`.

### Step 2: Install Gitpod app

- Install the [Gitpod App](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io/installations/new).

  Gitpod's GitHub app is similar to a CI server and will continuously prepare prebuilds for all your branches and pull requests - so you don't have to wait for installation of dependencies from the internet when you want to start coding.

### Step 3: First prebuild

- Start your first workspace with a prebuild by prefixing **https://gitpod.io#prebuild/** to the URL of the repository.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/my-cpp-template`

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the `init` commands in the _.gitpod.yml_ file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information see [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).

### Step 4: Enjoy being ready-to-code 🤙

Once the first prebuild ran, Gitpod starts an automated and fully configured developer environment in a workspace that is now ready for you to develop.

Other developers made their setup even more productive and supercharged their workflows with the following quick steps:

1. **Installing the browser extension**

You can install the Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

The extension simply adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitHub, and Bitbucket that prefixes the URL with `gitpod.io/#` so that you can easily open a new workspace from any Git context.

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

If you prefer to not install browser extensions then you can use the Gitpod [browser bookmarklet](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-bookmarklet) instead.

For our partner GitLab we have a native integration into their UI that you can enable here.

2. **Add your favorite VS Code themes and extensions**

You have access to all Visual Studio Code extensions published under the vendor neutral [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/). Install one by clicking the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and enter your favorite theme or VS Code extension.

Changes you make in your workspace such as themes and extensions are synced automatically to other workspaces.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/my-elm-template`

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the `init` commands in the _.gitpod.yml_ file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information see [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).

## Step 4: Enjoy being ready-to-code 🤙

Once the first prebuild ran, Gitpod starts an automated and fully configured developer environment in a workspace that is now ready for you to develop.

Other developers made their setup even more productive and supercharged their workflows with the following quick steps:

1. **Installing the browser extension**

You can install the Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

The extension simply adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitHub, and Bitbucket that prefixes the URL with `gitpod.io/#` so that you can easily open a new workspace from any Git context.

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

If you prefer to not install browser extensions then you can use the Gitpod [browser bookmarklet](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-bookmarklet) instead.

For our partner GitLab we have a native integration into their UI that you can enable here.

2. **Add your favorite VS Code themes and extensions**

You have access to all Visual Studio Code extensions published under the vendor neutral [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/). Install one by clicking the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and enter your favorite theme or VS Code extension.

Changes you make in your workspace such as themes and extensions are synced automatically to other workspaces.

3. **Start throwing away workspaces like paper towels**

You can now start to treat dev environments as automated resources you spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Dev environments become fully ephemeral.

You even can start switching between workspaces or open several workspaces on the same context - two for your feature, one for reviewing a PR/MR, one for a bug, one for another MR/PR.

Try it out and open 3 workspaces on the same context (e.g. on main or on an issue). 🤓

# Flask Quickstart

Learn how to set-up and understand the benefits of Gitpod **in less than 5 min** with our [Flask](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-python-flask) template.

The following guide will:

- Walk you through a real world example with an existing Gitpod config
- Introduce you to prebuilds
- Demonstrate the benefits of ephemeral developer environments

For simplicity we use a GitHub template, but Gitpod works similarly with GitLab and Bitbucket.

## Step 1: Clone Git repository

- Create a new repository based on the [Flask template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-python-flask/generate).
- Name it e.g. `my-flask-template`.

## Step 2: Install the Gitpod app

- Install the [Gitpod App](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io/installations/new).

  Gitpod's GitHub app is similar to a CI server and will continuously prepare prebuilds for all your branches and pull requests - so you don't have to wait for Maven or NPM downloading the internet when you want to start coding.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/<my-flask-template>`

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the `init` commands in the _.gitpod.yml_ file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/spring-petclinic`

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the `init` commands in the _.gitpod.yml_ file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information see [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).

## Step 4: Enjoy being ready-to-code 🤙

Once the first prebuild ran, Gitpod starts an automated and fully configured developer environment in a workspace that is now ready for you to develop.

Other developers made their setup even more productive and supercharged their workflows with the following quick steps:

1. **Installing the browser extension**

You can install the Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

The extension simply adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitHub, and Bitbucket that prefixes the URL with `gitpod.io/#` so that you can easily open a new workspace from any Git context.

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

If you prefer to not install browser extensions then you can use the Gitpod [browser bookmarklet](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-bookmarklet) instead.

For our partner GitLab we have a native integration into their UI that you can enable here.

2. **Add your favorite VS Code themes and extensions**

You have access to all Visual Studio Code extensions published under the vendor neutral [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/). Install one by clicking the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and enter your favorite theme or VS Code extension.

Changes you make in your workspace such as themes and extensions are synced automatically to other workspaces.

3. **Start throwing away workspaces like paper towels**

You can now start to treat dev environments as automated resources you spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Dev environments become fully ephemeral.

You even can start switching between workspaces or open several workspaces on the same context - two for your feature, one for reviewing a PR/MR, one for a bug, one for another MR/PR.

Try it out and open 3 workspaces on the same context (e.g. on main or on an issue). 🤓

## Next Steps

# Julia Quickstart

Learn how to set-up and understand the benefits of Gitpod **in less than 5 min** with our [Julia](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-julia) template.

The following guide will:

- Walk you through a real world example with an existing Gitpod config
- Introduce you to prebuilds
- Demonstrate the benefits of ephemeral developer environments

For simplicity we use a GitHub template, but Gitpod works similarly with GitLab and Bitbucket.

## Step 1: Clone Git repository

- Create a new repository based on the [Julia template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-julia/generate).
- Name it e.g. `my-julia-template`.

## Step 2: Install Gitpod app

- Install the [Gitpod App](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io/installations/new).

  Gitpod's GitHub app is similar to a CI server and will continuously prepare prebuilds for all your branches and pull requests - so you don't have to wait for Julia packages downloading from the internet when you want to start coding.

## Step 3: First prebuild

- Start your first workspace with a prebuild by prefixing **https://gitpod.io#prebuild/** to the URL of the repository.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/my-julia-template`

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the `init` commands in the _.gitpod.yml_ file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information see [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).

# Python Django Quickstart

Learn how to set-up and understand the benefits of Gitpod **in less than 5 min** with our [Python](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-python-django) template.

The following guide will:

- Walk you through a real world example with an existing Gitpod config
- Introduce you to prebuilds
- Demonstrate the benefits of ephemeral developer environments

For simplicity we use a GitHub template, but Gitpod works similarly with GitLab and Bitbucket.

## Step 1: Clone Git repository

- Create a new repository based on the [Python template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-python-django/generate).
- Name it e.g. `my-python-template`.

## Step 2: Install the Gitpod app

- Install the [Gitpod App](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io/installations/new).

  Gitpod's GitHub app is similar to a CI server and will continuously prepare prebuilds for all your branches and pull requests - so you don't have to wait for Maven or NPM downloading the internet when you want to start coding.

## Step 3: First prebuild

- Start your first workspace with a prebuild by prefixing **https://gitpod.io#prebuild/** to the URL of the repository.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/<my-python-template>`

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the `init` commands in the _.gitpod.yml_ file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information see [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).

## Step 4: Enjoy being ready-to-code 🤙

Once the first prebuild ran, Gitpod starts an automated and fully configured developer environment in a workspace that is now ready for you to develop.

Other developers made their setup even more productive and supercharged their workflows with the following quick steps:

1. **Installing the browser extension**

You can install the Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

The extension simply adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitHub, and Bitbucket that prefixes the URL with `gitpod.io/#` so that you can easily open a new workspace from any Git context.

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

If you prefer to not install browser extensions then you can use the Gitpod [browser bookmarklet](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-bookmarklet) instead.

For our partner GitLab we have a native integration into their UI that you can enable here.

2. **Add your favorite VS Code themes and extensions**

You have access to all Visual Studio Code extensions published under the vendor neutral [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/). Install one by clicking the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and enter your favorite theme or VS Code extension.

Changes you make in your workspace such as themes and extensions are synced automatically to other workspaces.

3. **Start throwing away workspaces like paper towels**

You can now start to treat dev environments as automated resources you spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Dev environments become fully ephemeral.

You even can start switching between workspaces or open several workspaces on the same context - two for your feature, one for reviewing a PR/MR, one for a bug, one for another MR/PR.

Try it out and open 3 workspaces on the same context (e.g. on main or on an issue). 🤓

1. **Installing the browser extension**

You can install the Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

The extension simply adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitHub, and Bitbucket that prefixes the URL with `gitpod.io/#` so that you can easily open a new workspace from any Git context.

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

If you prefer to not install browser extensions then you can use the Gitpod [browser bookmarklet](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-bookmarklet) instead.

For our partner GitLab we have a native integration into their UI that you can enable here.

2. **Add your favorite VS Code themes and extensions**

You have access to all Visual Studio Code extensions published under the vendor neutral [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/). Install one by clicking the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and enter your favorite theme or VS Code extension.

Changes you make in your workspace such as themes and extensions are synced automatically to other workspaces.

3. **Start throwing away workspaces like paper towels**

You can now start to treat dev environments as automated resources you spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Dev environments become fully ephemeral.

You even can start switching between workspaces or open several workspaces on the same context - two for your feature, one for reviewing a PR/MR, one for a bug, one for another MR/PR.

Try it out and open 3 workspaces on the same context (e.g. on main or on an issue). 🤓

## Next Steps

# Node/TypeScript/Express Quickstart

Learn how to set-up and understand the benefits of Gitpod **in less than 5 min** with our [Node/TypeScript/Express](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-typescript-node) template.

The following guide will:

- Walk you through a real world example with an existing Gitpod config
- Introduce you to prebuilds
- Demonstrate the benefits of ephemeral developer environments

For simplicity we use a GitHub template, but Gitpod works similarly with GitLab and Bitbucket.

## Step 1: Clone Git repository

- Create a new repository based on the [Node/TypeScript template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-typescript-node/generate).
- Name it e.g. `my-typescript-template`.

## Step 2: Install Gitpod app

- Install the [Gitpod App](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io/installations/new).

  Gitpod's GitHub app is similar to a CI server and will continuously prepare prebuilds for all your branches and pull requests - so you don't have to wait for Maven or NPM downloading from the internet when you want to start coding.

## Step 3: First prebuild

- Start your first workspace with a prebuild by prefixing **https://gitpod.io#prebuild/** to the URL of the repository.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/my-typescript-template`

Gitpod displays the prebuild progress status by running the `init` commands in the _.gitpod.yml_ file before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information see [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds).

## Step 4: Enjoy being ready-to-code 🤙

Once the first prebuild ran, Gitpod starts an automated and fully configured developer environment in a workspace that is now ready for you to develop.

Other developers made their setup even more productive and supercharged their workflows with the following quick steps:

1. **Installing the browser extension**

You can install the Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

# Bash in Gitpod

Bash is the default shell for Gitpod. However, if you're developing a Bash script yourself, you may want to configure additional language support.

## Example Repositories

Here are a few Bash example projects that are already automated with Gitpod:

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Repository                                        | Description                      | Try It                                                                                                                |

</div>

## VSCode Extensions

### ShellCheck

ShellCheck provides linting for common mistakes in your shell script.

To use ShellCheck in Gitpod, first, we must install the `shellcheck` tool. Here is a simple Dockerfile to get you started:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

USER gitpod

RUN brew install shellcheck
```

You should also install the shellcheck VS Code extension in Gitpod, by adding a [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) configuration file to your repository that looks like this (notice the `vscode` extensions section):

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile

vscode:
  extensions:
    - timonwong.shellcheck@0.9.0:hsU/Rd39aqPYowTqL+DbXg==
```

Not sure about ShellCheck? Try it in Gitpod!

[![gitpod-io/Gitpod-ShellCheck](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-ShellCheck)

### Bash IDE

![A Bash IDE demonstration](../../../static/images/docs/bashIDE.png)

Just to name a few things Bash IDE adds: Code completion, hovers, and diagnostic reporting.

To install Bash IDE to your repository add the following to your [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image)

```dockerfile
RUN npm i -g bash-language-server
```

Also the following in your
[.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml)

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - mads-hartmann.bash-ide-vscode@1.4.0:/qx+rdXE/fGTGWhelNf3aQ==
```

Not sure about Bash IDE? Try it in Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-BashIDE)

## Further Reading

- For more information about ShellCheck please see [shellcheck.net](https://shellcheck.net)

## Known issues

### The shellcheck program was not found

[It has been reported](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/1461#issuecomment-621232166) that shellcheck extension fails to detect shellcheck from homebrew which results in:
![shellcheck notification](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11302521/80605581-91110b80-8a33-11ea-9247-44cb33134cc9.png)

To resolve this you need to set `"shellcheck.executablePath": "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/shellcheck",` (or to path that point to shellcheck on your system), See https://github.com/vivek-verma202/GWAS_FM/pull/3/files

</div>

## Environment

### C++ Tools

All Gitpod workspaces come with the latest available `clang`, `gcc`, `cmake`, `gdb`, and other useful C++ tools pre-installed by default.

However, if you're missing some additional tools, you can simply run `brew install <tool_name>` to install it in the current workspace or [write your own .gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#creating-docker-images-for-gitpod) to install it across all workspaces for your repository.

## IDE Features

### Debugging

Since `gdb` is already pre-installed in Gitpod, you can already debug any C, C++, Go, etc. program directly from the Terminal with a single command.

However, you can also get the IDE's Debugging features to work with your C++ program, using GDB as a backend.

To enable C++ debugging for your project, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the Extensions panel (in the IDE's left vertical menu bar)

2. Use the Search feature to find the extension called "[Native Debug](https://open-vsx.org/extension/webfreak/debug)", then click on `Install`, and select `Install for this project`

3. Next, open the Debug panel (also in the IDE's left vertical menu bar), and click on the Gear (⚙️) icon to open the `launch.json` configuration file

4. Finally, configure debugging for your project by adding a GDB launch configuration. You can use auto-completion for assistance. In the end, your `launch.json` should look something like this:

```js
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
      {
          "type": "gdb",
          "request": "launch",
          "name": "Debug Firefox (GDB)",
          "target": "./obj-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/dist/bin/firefox",
          "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
          "valuesFormatting": "parseText"
      }
  ]
}
```

Note: This example GDB launch configuration points to a compiled Firefox browser binary. You'll need to adjust it to point to your project's own compiled binary.

With this, you should be able to set breakpoints in your C++ code directly from the code editor margin, then start a debugging session from the Debug panel. The IDE should then show you debug information, hopefully pause execution on your breakpoint, and allow you to step through the code.

If that doesn't work, please feel free to ask for help in [community.gitpod.io](https://community.gitpod.io) and we'll be happy to help you make debugging work for your project.

For a more in-depth walk-through of how do debug applications, please [refer to this comment on GitHub](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/4805#issuecomment-883228543).

# Deno in Gitpod

It's easy to set up Deno in Gitpod.

## Setting up the Dockerfile

Add a Dockerfile to your project as [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image):

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

RUN curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
RUN /home/gitpod/.deno/bin/deno completions bash > /home/gitpod/.bashrc.d/90-deno && \
    echo 'export DENO_INSTALL="/home/gitpod/.deno"' >> /home/gitpod/.bashrc.d/90-deno && \
    echo 'export PATH="$DENO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"' >> /home/gitpod/.bashrc.d/90-deno
```

And configure this Dockerfile in your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml):

```YAML
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

It'll run the latest Deno version and install the Bash completions.

## Example Repositories

Here are a few Deno example projects that are already automated with Gitpod:

## Installing the .NET Tools

To get all the .NET tools that you need pre-installed in your Gitpod workspaces, use the following base image in your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml):

```YAML
image: gitpod/workspace-dotnet
```

If your project requires a GUI or Virtual Desktop, please use this image instead:

```YAML
image: gitpod/workspace-dotnet-vnc
```

This will give you a full GUI Virtual Desktop for your .NET application! The Virtual Desktop will be running on port `6080`.

## Compiling .NET Code in Gitpod

To compile your **C#** or **F#** Code in Gitpod, run `dotnet build <FILE>`, where `<FILE>` is the path to the C# or F# project file or .NET solution file you want to compile.

## Running .NET Code in Gitpod

To run your code after it has been compiled run `dotnet <FILE>` where `<FILE>` is the path to the EXE file you want to run. You can also run application with `dotnet run <FILE>` where `<FILE>` is the path to the C# or F# project file you want to compile and run.

## Running .NET Code in watch-mode

Alternatively, you can also run your application in so-called watch-mode. In such configuration the application will recompile and rerun itself every time you save any source file belonging to the project. To run your code in watch-mode use `dotnet watch --project <FILE> run` where `<FILE>` is the path to the C# or F# project file you want to compile and run.

## Useful VSCode Extensions

### C#

The official C# extension from Microsoft [is proprietary](https://aka.ms/VSCode-DotNet-DbgLicense) and unfortunately cannot be used. The MIT licensed [muhammad-sammy.csharp](https://open-vsx.org/extension/muhammad-sammy/csharp) extension from Samsung brings code completion, snippets, auto-formatting, peek definition, refactoring, hover documentation and breakpoint debugging for C# however!

![C# Extension Demo](../../../static/images/docs/CSharpDemo.png)

To add this extension to your repository, add the following to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml):

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - muhammad-sammy.csharp
```

### F#

The [Ionide-fsharp](https://ionide.io/) extensin gives F# developers the following features:

- A Widget for your F# needs
- Auto completion
- Shows errors inline
- Quickfix
- Goto definition
- Peek definition
- And more...

![Ionide fsharp Example](../../../static/images/docs/Iondine_Example.png)

To add this extension to your repository, add the following to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml):

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - Ionide.Ionide-fsharp@4.6.2:yBkAE6j7z7gJ5WEcyMjEOg==

# Go in Gitpod

Gitpod includes Go in the default image, but if you need to customize your Go version or IDE setup in Gitpod, this guide will help you.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with:

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) and Linux [environment variables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/environment_variables).

## Getting started / Quick Start

`youtube: ij1msCffQZA`

To see a full working Go application, take a look at [gitpod-samples/template-golang-cli](https://github.com/gitpod-samples/template-golang-cli). To update an existing Go application, follow the steps below in this guide.

<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-samples/template-golang-cli">
    <img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg" alt="Push" align="center" >
</a>

## Installing Dependencies

### The default base image

The default Gitpod workspace image default is [workspace-full](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

This base image includes:

- [Go](https://golang.org/) `v1.19.1` (`go version`)

> **Note:** We discuss how to set up a [custom base image](/docs/introduction/languages/go#setting-up-a-custom-dockerfile) later in the guide.

### Updating Go Versions

Gitpod uses the latest stable version of Go by default. If you want to use a different version, you can use the [Go Version Manager](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) to install and manage multiple versions of Go or you can following their [official guide](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install).

### Setting up a custom Dcokerfile

`youtube: jFsbmcXCRf8`

To ensure Gitpod workspaces always start with the correct dependencies, configure a Dockerfile:

1. Create a `.gitpod.yml`

```bash
touch .gitpod.yml
```

2. Create a custom Dockerfile

```bash
touch .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

3. Reference your newly created Dockerfile in your `.gitpod.yml`

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

4. Update your `.gitpod.Dockerfile` to install your preferred [dependency versions](https://go.dev/project)

```dockerfile
# You can find the new timestamped tags here: https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-base/tags
FROM gitpod/workspace-base:latest

# Change your version here
ENV GO_VERSION=1.17

# For ref, see: https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/61df77aad71689504112e1087bb7e26d45a43d10/chunks/lang-go/Dockerfile#L10
ENV GOPATH=$HOME/go-packages
ENV GOROOT=$HOME/go
ENV PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
RUN curl -fsSL https://dl.google.com/go/go${GO_VERSION}.linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzs \
    && printf '%s\n' 'export GOPATH=/workspace/go' \
                      'export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH' > $HOME/.bashrc.d/300-go
```

5. Commit and push both `.gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.Dockerfile`

```bash
git commit -m "configuring gitpod with go" && git push
```

6. Start a **new workspace** from the branch with the committed `.gitpod.Dockerfile`

For example, opening: `gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod`

7. Test your dependencies are correct in the new workspace

```bash
go version
```

> **Note:** If your changes are not taking effect, ensure your workspace is building from the correct [context](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url), where your `gitpod.yml` or `gitpod.Dockerfile` are checked in to version control and are on the branch or commit that you are opening.

See [configure Docker](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) for more.

### Using the `dep` dependency manager in Gitpod

If your project uses the [`dep` _(deprecated - v0.5.4)_](https://golang.github.io/dep/) dependency manager then you need to add a [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) to your project. A basic example that extends the default workspace image might be something like:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

USER gitpod

RUN sudo apt-get install go-dep
```

Also, don't forget to reference the above Dockerfile in your `.gitpod.yml` configuration file, like so:

```YAML
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile

tasks:
  - init: dep ensure

vscode:
  extensions:
    - golang.go
    - premparihar.gotestexplorer
```

## Debugging your Go application in Gitpod

### Debugging your Go applications in VS Code

Here is a quick clip on how to automatically configure debugging for Go!

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Go debugging example" src="/images/docs/GoDebug.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>Go debugging example</figcaption>
</figure>

So, basically in this video we:

1. First, open the Go file that we want to debug
2. Then, go to the debug menu and select "Add Configuration..."
3. Next, in the dropdown choose "Go launch file"
4. Finally, start debugging your Go program!

You can also create the Go debug configuration file manually

To start debugging your Go application in Gitpod, please create a new directory called `.theia/`, and inside add a file called `launch.json`, finally, add the following to it:

```json
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Launch file",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "debug",
      "program": "${file}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, simply open the Go file you want to debug, open the Debug panel (in the left vertical toolbar, click the icon with the crossed-out-spider), and click the green "Run" button.

<br>

To see a basic repository with Go debugging, please check out [gitpod-samples/template-golang-cli](https://github.com/gitpod-samples/template-golang-cli):

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-samples/template-golang-cli)

### Debugging your Go applications in GoLand

Steps to debug your Go application in GoLand:

1. Open your project in Gitpod with GoLand.
2. Open the `main.go` file in the editor.
3. Click on the `Run` menu and select `Edit Configurations...`.
4. Click on the `+` button and select `Go Application`.
5. In the `Go Application` window, enter the name of the configuration and the path to the file you want to debug.
6. Click on the `Apply` button.
7. Click on the `Debug` button to start debugging your Go application.

<img class="shadow-medium rounded-xl max-w-xl mt-x-small" src="/images/docs/goland-debug.webp" alt="Debug on GoLand in Gitpod" loading="lazy"/>

### Using `$GOPATH`

Older Go projects without module support need a <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization" target="_blank">specific workspace layout</a>:
the source code of your repository and its dependencies must be in the directories

```sh
src/[repository-provider]/[repository-owner]/[repository-name]
```

in the `$GOPATH`. Using the `.gitpod.yml` file, you can bring about such a workspace layout. Here is
how we do that for the example <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/definitely-gp/blob/master/go-gin-app/.gitpod.yml" target="_blank">go-gin-app</a> repository:

```yaml
---
checkoutLocation: "src/github.com/demo-apps/go-gin-app"
workspaceLocation: "."
tasks:
  - init: |
      cd /workspace/src/github.com/demo-apps/go-gin-app &&
      go get -v ./... &&
      go build -o app
    command: |
      cd /workspace/src/github.com/demo-apps/go-gin-app &&
      ./app
```

In more detail:

- By default, Gitpod clones the repository into the directory `/workspace`, which becomes the
  root directory for the workspace. With [`checkoutLocation`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml#checkoutlocation) and [`workspaceLocation`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml#workspacelocation) you can
  change this behavior (the paths are taken relative to `/workspace`).
- Gitpod preconfigures the `$GOPATH` environment variable to include the directory `/workspace/go`.
- With `go get -v ./...` we retrieve the sources of the dependencies from GitHub.
- To build the app, we run `go build -o app`.
- Lastly, we start the application.

## [emmet](https://emmet.io/) &nbsp;Support

![emmet demo](../../../static/images/docs/emmet.png)
Gitpod comes with [emmet](https://emmet.io/) support right out of the box giving you access to powerful snippets and completions

## Live Preview

![Live Preview Demo](../../../static/images/docs/html-preview.png)
With Gitpod you can open a preview for HTML files while you are coding. You can do this by opening a web server `python -m http.server 8000`.

You can also automate this in your [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file, so that every time you start a new workspace your preview is ready to go. For example:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Start web server
    init: python -m http.server 8000

ports:
  - port: 8000
    onOpen: open-preview
```

## Try It!

Want to see a minimal example in action? Try it out by opening an example on Gitpod:

# Java in Gitpod

Gitpod comes with great support for Java. This guide walks you through how to fully configure a Java application using Gitpod.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with:

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) and Linux [environment variables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/environment_variables).

## Getting started / Quick Start

`youtube: ij1msCffQZA`

To see a full working Java application, take a look at [gitpod-io/spring-petclinic](https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic/). To update an existing Java application, follow the steps below in this guide.

<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic">
    <img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg" alt="Push" align="center" >
</a>

## Installing dependencies

### The default base image

The default Gitpod workspace image default is [workspace-full](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

Along with other languages and tools, this base image includes:

- [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) `v5.16.0` (`sdk version`)
- [Java](https://www.java.com) `v11.0.16` (`java -version`)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) `v7.5.1` (`gradle -version`)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) `v3.8.6` (`mvn -version`)

> **Note:** We discuss how to set up a [custom base image](/docs/introduction/languages/java#setting-up-a-custom-dockerfile) later in the guide.

### Updating Java, Maven & Gradle

For alternative versions to those provided in the Gitpod base image, with [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/usage#listversions) you can quickly update your dependencies: `sdk install <candidate> [version]`

> **Important:** Dynamically swapping Java, Maven or Gradle versions manually is a quick way to explore Gitpod. However, for day-to-day development **strongly recommend to add explicit dependency versions in your gitpod.yml or Dockerfile**.

#### Updating Java version

- `sdk list java` - to see available java versions
- `sdk install java 18.0.1.fx-zulu` - to install a specific version

#### Updating Maven version

- `sdk list maven` - to see available maven versions
- `sdk install maven 3.8.6` - to install a specific version

#### Updating Gradle version

- `sdk list gradle` - to see available gradle versions
- `sdk install gradle 7.4.1` - to install a specific version

### Setting up a custom Dockerfile

`youtube: jFsbmcXCRf8`

To ensure Gitpod workspaces always start with the correct dependencies, configure a Dockerfile:

1. Create a `.gitpod.yml`

```bash
touch .gitpod.yml
```

2. Create a custom Dockerfile

```bash
touch .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

3. Reference your newly created Dockerfile in your `.gitpod.yml`

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

4. Update your `.gitpod.Dockerfile` to install your dependency versions

```Dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

USER gitpod

RUN bash -c ". /home/gitpod/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && \
    sdk install java 17.0.3-ms && \
    sdk default java 17.0.3-ms"
```

5. Commit and push both `gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.Dockerfile`

```bash
git commit -m "configuring gitpod with java" && git push
```

6. Start a **new workspace** from the branch with the committed `.gitpod.Dockerfile`

For example, opening: `gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod`

7. Test your dependencies are correct in the new workspace

```bash
sdk current
```

> **Note:** If your changes are not taking effect, ensure your workspace is building from the correct [context](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url), where your `gitpod.yml` or `gitpod.Dockerfile` are checked in to version control and are on the branch or commit that you are opening.

See [configure Docker](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) for more.

## Build and run your application

### Building a Java application

To build your application, you'll need to configure a [start task](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks).

Start tasks are processes that are initiated on every workspace start. Depending on your project setup, start tasks can be used to build your application, run your application directly, or start any necessary tools for the application to run, such as starting database processes.

1. Add the command to build your application to your `.gitpod.yml`

**Example with Gradle**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: gradle build
```

**Example with Maven**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: mvn package
```

2. **Optional:** Validate by stopping and starting (restart) your workspace

```bash
gp stop
```

3. **Optional:** Validate your commands by running [`gp tasks`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#tasks)

```shell
gp tasks
```

> **Tip:** If you're using [VS Code Browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser) or [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode), then your tasks will open as terminal windows. You can configure their layout using the [openMode](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks#openmode) property.

> **Note:** We are using the `init` property so that we can perform application building during a [prebuild](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds), for increased performance. We'll discuss prebuilds more later on.

See [start tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) and [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.

### Running a Java application

To run your application, you have two options:

1. **Update your start task command** - Starting your application using the `command` start task will run the start process on workspace start. With both [VS Code Browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode) and [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser), tasks are automatically opened in the terminal(s). With [IntelliJ](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij) / [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), configured tasks can be viewed by running `gp tasks` in the workspace.
2. **Use a run / launch configuration** - Alternatively, you can commit a [run/debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA](/docs/introduction/languages/java#configuring-jetbrains-rundebug-configurations) or a [launch configuration in VS Code](/docs/introduction/languages/java#configuring-vs-code-launch-configurations) as a way to start your application.

#### Using start tasks to run Java

1. Add a `command` for starting your application to your `.gitpod.yml`

**Example with Gradle**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: gradle build
    command: gradle run
```

**Example with Maven**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: mvn package
    command: mvn exec:java
```

1. **Optional:** Validate by stopping and starting (restart) your workspace

```bash
gp stop
```

3. **Optional:** Validate your commands by running [`gp tasks`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#tasks)

```shell
gp tasks
```

### Configuring environment variables

`youtube: dehln1E8ylY`

Gitpod supports encrypted, user-specific environment variables.

Environment variables are stored as part of your user settings and can be used to set access tokens, or pass any other kind of user-specific information to your workspaces. You can set environment variables using `gp env`, or in your project and account settings.

See [environment variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables) for more.

### Configuring ports

When your project starts a service that listens on a given port, Gitpod automatically serves traffic to this port of your application on an authenticated URL.

If you want to configure ports, such as: their visibility, what Gitpod does when it detects a new port being available, etc, you can do that in the ports section of the .gitpod.yml configuration file.

For example, add the following to your `.gitpod.yml` to configure port `3000` to open in your browser on workspace start.

```yaml
ports:
  - port: 3000
    onOpen: open-browser
```

See [configuring ports](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports) for more

### Configuring localhost

Your development application might rely on the `localhost` hostname to effectively run.

To ensure your localhost address works with Gitpod, you have two options:

1. **Replace localhost references** - Swap `localhost` references within the application with the output of `gp url <port>`, typically via an [environment variable](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables).

**Example:** Using the `DEV_ENVIRONMENT_HOST` environment variable instead of localhost within the application, configured in the `command` of the `.gitpod.yml` start tasks.

```yaml
tasks:
  - command: |
    export DEV_ENVIRONMENT_HOST=`gp url 3000`
    java <application-entry>
```

2. **Setup localhost port forwarding** - Connect your local machine with your running workspace means that you don't need to replace localhost references, to do that you'll need to configure port forwarding. Port forwarding is useful if you're working with a framework that needs localhost, and the application cannot be reconfigured.

With [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode), local port-forwarding is handled automatically and can be configured via the ports view within VS Code Desktop.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Port forwarding in VS Code Desktop" src="/images/editors/port-forwarding-vscode-desktop.png">
    <figcaption>Port forwarding in VS Code Desktop</figcaption>
</figure>

With IntelliJ IDEA using [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) you can setup remote port-forwarding manually.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Port forwarding in a JetBrains IDE" src="/images/jetbrains-gateway/port-forward-jetbrains.png">
    <figcaption>Port forwarding in a JetBrains IDE</figcaption>
</figure>

Alternatively, by using [local companion](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/local-companion) all workspace ports will be forwarded automatically.

See [configuring ports](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports) for more.

### Configuring VS Code extensions

To set default plugins to be installed for all users starting a workspace for the project, add a list of the JetBrains plugin identifiers to your `.gitpod.yml` under `vscode.extensions`.

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - vscjava.vscode-java-pack
```

See [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.

### Configuring VS Code Launch configurations

Launch configurations can be shared by committing the `.vscode/launch.json` file to version control. To use a launch configuration with Java, need Java version 11 or above, and some VS Code extensions. Assuming you have configured your base image with a compatible JDK version as described above, a simple way to get set up is by adding the Extension Pack for Java will configure the correct VS Code extensions. Alternatively, you can selectively choose the extensions to install.

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - vscjava.vscode-java-pack
```

See [Debugging in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) and [VS Code Java Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/extensions) for more.

### Configuring JetBrains Run/Debug configurations

To share your run/debug configurations, you can commit their definitions to source control. Since the `.idea` folder contains lots of information used for IntelliJ (which can include sensitive information or secrets) you may wish to ignore the `.idea` from version control, and explicitly allow `.idea/runConfigurations`.

Add run/debug configurations to git, by adding the following to your `.gitignore`.

```
/.idea/*
!/.idea/runConfigurations
```

See [JetBrains Run/Debug configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) documentation for more.

### Configuring JetBrains Plugins

To set default extensions to be installed for all users starting a workspace for the project, add a list of the VS Code extension identifiers to your `.gitpod.yml`.

```yaml
jetbrains:
  intellij:
    plugins:
      - com.intellij.lang.jsgraphql
```

See [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.

## Optimising Java Applications

Gitpod prebuilds reduce wait time by installing dependencies or running builds before you start a new workspace. By default, Gitpod prepares prebuilt workspaces for all changes on the default branch and pull/merge requests coming from the same repository. However, prebuilds save only the `workspace` directory, any files stored outside of the workspace directory will be lost. For Java applications, we recommend to execute build commands within an `init` startup task.

`youtube: DwkoOz1GSVg`

See [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) and [start tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) for more.

### Optimising JetBrains indexing

> JetBrains prebuilds support (via gitpod.yml) is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

Gitpod currently has early support for improved indexing performance with JetBrains IDEs that works out-of-the-box. You can enable this setting via the `.gitpod.yml`.

**Example:** Index both the stable and latest of the IntelliJ IDE

```yaml
jetbrains:
  intellij:
    prebuilds:
      version: stable
```

### Caching Maven dependencies

The default cache location for Maven is the `.m2` directory. However, since this location is by default outside of the `/workspace` directory caches will not be stored as part of a prebuild.

If you are using the [workspace-full](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) image, Maven caching configuration is already enabled.

To configure Maven caching, add the following to your custom [Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image).

1. Create an `.m2` directory in the users (`gitpod`) home directory.

```bash
mkdir /home/gitpod/.m2
```

2. Create a `settings.xml` and configure `localRepository` within `workspace`.

```bash
printf '<settings>\n  <localRepository>/workspace/m2-repository/</localRepository>\n</settings>\n' > /home/gitpod/.m2/settings.xml
```

See [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) for more.

### Caching Gradle dependencies

The default location of the gradle home is `$USER_HOME/.gradle`, however, since this location is by default outside of the `/workspace` directory caches will not be stored as part of a prebuild.

If you are using the [workspace-full](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) image, Gradle caching configuration is already enabled.

To configure Gradle caching, add the following to your custom [Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image).

```
ENV GRADLE_USER_HOME=/workspace/.gradle/
```

See [prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) for more.

## Personalizing Gitpod

All settings introduced so far, such as `.gitpod.yml` and `Dockerfile` apply for all users using of the gitpod project. To apply personalisation, consider setting up [dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles), the Gitpod [Browser Extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension),

### Dotfiles

Dotfiles allow you to setup per-user configurations in your Gitpod workspace, such as modifying your shell and adding command aliases. To configure Gitpod to use your own dotfiles for all your workspaces, enter the URL of a public dotfiles repository in your Gitpod [preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences).

See [dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles) for more.

### Browser Extension

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

To make opening Gitpod workspaces easier, install the Gitpod browser extension, which enables an "Open in Gitpod" button on GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

See [Browser Extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension) for more.

### Configure your IDE or editor

    <figcaption>Updating Gitpod IDE preferences to a JetBrains IDE</figcaption>
</figure>

With Gitpod, you can work with [VS Code Browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser), [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode) or [JetBrains](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) IDEs, such as [IntelliJ IDEA](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij). Setting your preference ensures all future workspaces start with the chosen IDE or editor. Visit the [preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) page to configure these settings.

See [IDEs & Editors](/docs/references/ides-and-editors) for more.

### VS Code Desktop Settings Sync

![Enable Settings Sync with Gitpod](/images/editors/enable-signin-with-gitpod-dark-theme.png)
_Enable Settings Sync with Gitpod_

VS Code Desktop by default is not setup to sync your VS Code settings (e.g. your fonts, layouts, etc) with VS Code running in the browser of Gitpod. You can configure Gitpod to sync settings between browser and desktop by running the command palette action "Settings Sync: Enable signing in with Gitpod" from the Gitpod VS Code extension.

See [VS Code settings sync](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/settings-sync) for more.

# JavaScript in Gitpod

Gitpod comes with great built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and tools like Node.js, npm, pnpm & yarn pre-installed with [Gitpod workspace image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image). This guide walks you through how to fully configure a JavaScript application using Gitpod.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with:

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) and Linux [environment variables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/environment_variables).

## Getting started / Quick Start

`youtube: ij1msCffQZA`

To see a full working Node/TypeScript application, take a look at [gitpod-samples/template-typescript-node](https://github.com/gitpod-samples/template-typescript-node). To update an existing JavaScript application, follow the steps below in this guide.

<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-samples/template-typescript-node">
    <img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg" alt="Push" align="center" >
</a>

## Installing dependencies

### The default base image

The default Gitpod workspace image default is [workspace-full](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

Along with other languages and tools, this base image includes:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `v16.18.1` (`node -v`)
- [Node Package Manager - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) `v8.19.2` (`npm -v`)
- [Node Version Manager - nvm](https://nvm.sh) `0.39.0` (`nvm -v`)

> **Note:** We discuss how to set up a [custom base image](/docs/introduction/languages/javascript#setting-up-a-custom-dockerfile) later in the guide.

### Updating Node Versions

Gitpod comes with the latest stable Node.js version pre-installed but let's say your project uses a different version of `node` (say `14.8.0` for example), well the good news is that Gitpod also comes with `nvm` (a tool used to manage multiple active Node.js versions) installed. To install and configure the desired version of node: `nvm install 14.8.0` and `nvm use 14.8.0` (you can also use `nvm alias default 14.8.0` to set the default version of node) or you can setup [custom Dockerfile](/docs/introduction/languages/javascript#setting-up-a-custom-dockerfile) to install the desired version of node & other required tools.

### Setting up a custom Dcokerfile

`youtube: jFsbmcXCRf8`

To ensure Gitpod workspaces always start with the correct dependencies, configure a Dockerfile:

1. Create a `.gitpod.yml`

```bash
touch .gitpod.yml
```

2. Create a custom Dockerfile

```bash
touch .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

3. Reference your newly created Dockerfile in your `.gitpod.yml`

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

4. Update your `.gitpod.Dockerfile` to install your dependency versions

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full:latest

RUN bash -c 'VERSION="14.8.0" \
    && source $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm install $VERSION \
    && nvm use $VERSION && nvm alias default $VERSION'

RUN echo "nvm use default &>/dev/null" >> ~/.bashrc.d/51-nvm-fix
```

5. Commit and push both `.gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.Dockerfile`

```bash
git commit -m "configuring gitpod with javascript" && git push
```

6. Start a **new workspace** from the branch with the committed `.gitpod.Dockerfile`

For example, opening: `gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod`

7. Test your dependencies are correct in the new workspace

```bash
node -v
```

> **Note:** If your changes are not taking effect, ensure your workspace is building from the correct [context](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url), where your `gitpod.yml` or `gitpod.Dockerfile` are checked in to version control and are on the branch or commit that you are opening.

See [configure Docker](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) for more.

## Build and run your application

### Building a JavaScript application

To build your application, you'll need to configure a [start task](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks).

Start tasks are processes that are initiated on every workspace start. Depending on your project setup, start tasks can be used to build your application, run your application directly, or start any necessary tools for the application to run, such as starting database processes.

1. Add the command to build your application to your `.gitpod.yml`

**Example with npm**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: npm install && npm run build
```

**Example with yarn**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: yarn install && yarn build
```

2. **Optional:** Validate by stopping and starting (restart) your workspace

```bash
gp stop
```

3. **Optional:** Validate your commands by running [`gp tasks`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#tasks)

```shell
gp tasks
```

> **Tip:** If you're using [VS Code Browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser) or [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode), then your tasks will open as terminal windows. You can configure their layout using the [openMode](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks#openmode) property.

> **Note:** We are using the `init` property so that we can perform application building during a [prebuild](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds), for increased performance. We'll discuss prebuilds more later on.

See [start tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) and [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.

### Running a JavaScript application

To run your application, you have two options:

1. **Update your start task command** - Starting your application using the `command` start task will run the start process on workspace start. With both [VS Code Browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode) and [VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser), tasks are automatically opened in the terminal(s). With [IntelliJ](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij) / [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), configured tasks can be viewed by running `gp tasks` in the workspace.

#### Using start tasks to run JavaScript

1. Add a `command` for starting your application to your `.gitpod.yml`

**Example with npm**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: npm install && npm run build
    command: npm run dev
```

**Example with yarn**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: yarn install && yarn build
    command: yarn start
```

2. **Optional:** Validate by stopping and starting (restart) your workspace

```bash
gp stop
```

3. **Optional:** Validate your commands by running [`gp tasks`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#tasks)

```shell
gp tasks
```

### Using ESLint for linting

If your project's `package.json` does not mention ESLint as a dependency then you have to install it first. For installing it add the following to the end of the `init` phase of your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) as shown:

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: npm install && npm run build && npm install -g eslint
```

and then search for `eslint` in the extensions tab and then install it from there using the install button as shown in the screenshot.

![Install ESLint in Gitpod](.../../../static/images/docs/eslint-extension.png)

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Especially when it comes to Frontend Projects, the dev-server should be able to auto-reload on file changes. The implementation varies from server to server. To make this work, some additional config is required:

### Vite

In your `.gitpod.yml` file, you should export the workspace url for the port your server runs into the environment.

```yaml title=".gitpod.yml"
tasks:
  - init: npm install
    command: |
      export HMR_HOST=`gp url 5173`
```

After exporting it to the environment, the URL can be accessed in the `vite.config.js`. With the following snippet, you are able to configure HMR to work inside Gitpod, as well as on localhost.

```js title="vite.config.js"
const config = () => ({
  server: {
    hmr: {
      clientPort: process.env.HMR_HOST ? 443 : 5173,
      host: process.env.HMR_HOST
        ? new URL(process.env.HMR_HOST).hostname
        : "localhost",
    },
  },
});

export default config;
```

### Webpack

Similar to the setup in Vite, the setup for Webpack consists of two steps: exporting the URL to the environment and consuming the environment variable in the config:

```yaml title=".gitpod.yml"
tasks:
  - init: npm install
    command: |
      export HMR_HOST=`gp url 3000`
```

After the workspace URL with the given port is exported to the environment, it can be used in the `webpack.config.js` to determine the right port and hostname.

```js title="webpack.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    client: {
      webSocketURL: {
        hostname: process.env.HMR_HOST
          ? new URL(process.env.HMR_HOST).hostname
          : "localhost",
        port: process.env.HMR_HOST ? 443 : 3000,
        protocol: "wss",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Use of Private Packages

If you want to use private packages from npm or yarn on Gitpod, you can use the [`NPM_TOKEN`](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens) environment variable. You can set it in your [Gitpod user settings](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#using-the-account-settings).

---

<script context="module">

</script>

# Kotlin in Gitpod

To work with Kotlin in Gitpod, you will need to properly configure your repository. Here is how to do it.

## Installing Kotlin

To install Kotlin in Gitpod add the following to your [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image):

```dockerfile
RUN brew install kotlin
```

A full example could look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

USER gitpod
RUN brew install kotlin
```

## VS Code extensions

### Kotlin Language

This extension provides Kotlin language support for Gitpod and other IDEs, with:

- Syntax highlighting
- Code snippets
- Region code folding

To get it, open Gitpod's **Extensions** panel (left vertical menu), then search for "Kotlin" and install the extension by Mathias Fröhlich for your project. Next, commit the [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file that was automatically created (or updated) by Gitpod.

### Code Runner

While this extension isn't Kotlin-specific, but allows to run code snippets in many different languages, including Kotlin.

To get it, open Gitpod's Extensions panel, then search for "Code Runner" and install it for your project.

## Try it

Please use the button below to see a gitpodified [Kotlin example project](https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-Kotlin) in Gitpod:

<script context="module">

</script>

# LaTeX in Gitpod

This tutorial will demonstrate how to configure Gitpod to work with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) files. You can find a complete [example repository](https://github.com/ptrottier/latex) at the end.

## Installing LaTeX

First, you will probably want to install LaTeX in Gitpod. To do this, add a new file to your repository called [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), and add the following content to it:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

# Install LaTeX
RUN sudo apt-get -q update && \
    sudo apt-get install -yq texlive && \
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Next, create a file called [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and add the following to it:

```YAML
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

Now commit both files into source control, and push them to your GitHub or GitLab repository.

This will be your base configuration for LaTeX in Gitpod — from now on, every time you create a new Gitpod workspace for your repository, it will be configured as specified in your `.gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.Dockerfile`.

## Automatically compiling LaTeX files on save

One way to achieve this is to install `inotify-tools` by modifying your earlier `.gitpod.Dockerfile` like so:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

# Install LaTeX
RUN sudo apt-get -q update && \
    sudo apt-get install -yq texlive-full inotify-tools && \
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Next, modify your `.gitpod.yml` like so:

```YAML
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile

tasks:
  - name: LaTeX auto-rebuild
    command: >
      while find . -name '*.tex' | xargs inotifywait -qqre modify .; do \
        latexmk -pdf ; \
      done
  - name: Terminal
```

This will start a watcher process that automatically recompiles your `*.tex` files when they are changed. Note: The watcher process will start in a separate Terminal on every workspace start.

## VSCode Extensions

### TexLab

This extension provides rich editing support for the LaTeX typesetting system powered by the [TexLab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab-vscode) language server.

To install it in Gitpod, simply download the corresponding `*.vsix` file [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/), and then drag-and-drop it into Gitpod's Extensions view (which can be found in the left vertical menu bar).

This will automatically append something like this to your `.gitpod.yml` file:

```yml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - efoerster.texlab@1.10.0:/Vq+k9Ug/81LYWajjTgMpA==
```

(Note: You can also append these lines yourself if you don't want to download & re-upload the `*.vsix` file.)

### LaTeX Workshop

Another great LaTeX extension is [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop):

> Boost LaTeX typesetting efficiency with preview, compile, autocomplete, colorize, and more.

It is also available [on Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/James-Yu/latex-workshop).

### LaTeX Snippets

There is also [LaTeX Snippets](https://github.com/JeffersonQin/VSCode-LaTeX-Snippets):

> This extension includes a variety of snippets for LaTeX including making environments and plotting images for functions, etc.

## Try it!

To see a complete minimal example repository with a Gitpod configuration for LaTeX, including most of the tools we've covered, see [ptrottier/latex](https://github.com/ptrottier/latex). You can try it in your browser:

## Switching PHP versions

Gitpod installs PHP from [Ondřej Surý's PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php) in [here](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/main/chunks/tool-nginx/Dockerfile). The default version should be set to PHP8.

But let's say you want to switch to PHP7.4, follow along!
At first, add a [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) file on your repo with the following content in it:

```dockerfile
# You can find the new timestamped tags here: https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full/tags
FROM gitpod/workspace-full:2022-05-08-14-31-53

# Change your version here
RUN sudo update-alternatives --set php $(which php7.4)
```

Secondly, reference the above Dockerfile in your `.gitpod.yml` configuration file, like so:

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

Now you can [See it in action on a new workspace](/docs/references/gitpod-yml#see-it-in-action)

## Debugging PHP in Gitpod

![PHP debugging example](../../../static/images/docs/phpDebug.png)

The PHP Debug extension allows debugging PHP applications from within Gitpod.

To get this extension for your project, you must do two things:

First, you must create a [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) for your repository:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full:2022-05-08-14-31-53

RUN sudo install-packages php-xdebug
```

Second, reference the above Dockerfile in a [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file, and then also install the extension, like so:

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile

vscode:
  extensions:
    - felixfbecker.php-debug
```

Now you can [See it in action on a new workspace](/docs/references/gitpod-yml#see-it-in-action)

Later, you can head over to `Run and Debug` on the left hand side and have fun debugging PHP! You can also create a `launch.json` file.

Finally, here is a full [example repository](https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-PHP-Debug) containing the complete Gitpod PHP debug configuration described above. You can try it by clicking here:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-PHP-Debug)

## PECL Package Manager

Gitpod's default workspace image also comes with the [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/) package manager pre-installed. To install packages with it, you must use `sudo pecl install <EXTENSION>` in your repository's [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), e.g. like so:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

RUN sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net && \
    sudo pecl install <EXTENSION>
```

where `<EXTENSION>` is the PHP extension you want to install, e.g. `xdebug`.

## Setting GitHub token to Composer

Some composer plugins like [symfony/flex](https://github.com/symfony/flex) does direct API call against GitHub to fetch additional information. These unauthenticated requests will be rate-limited and may fail your task steps. To fix this behavior we can use the default credential-helper to obtain a GitHub Token and configure composer properly

```bash
composer config --global github-oauth.github.com $(printf '%s\n' host=github.com | gp credential-helper get | sort | head -2 | tail -1 | sed 's;password=;;')
```

# Python in Gitpod

Gitpod comes with great support for Python built-in. Still, depending on your project, you might want to further optimize the experience.

## Python Project Examples

Before we get started, here are some examples of already-[gitpodified](/guides/gitpodify) repositories!

## Pandas

Welcome data scientists! This part of the guide will show you how to configure Gitpod for Pandas development.

### Try Pandas in Gitpod

To see a minimal project with Pandas installed and configured, please check out [gitpod-io/Gitpod-Pandas](https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-Pandas):

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-Pandas)

### Use Gitpod for Pandas development

Pandas Team has their official docs on how to use Gitpod for Pandas development. Please check out [Pandas Team's Gitpod guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing_gitpod.html).

## Python Versions

Run `pyenv versions` to see which Python versions are pre-installed in Gitpod.

The easiest way to install a new Python version is to use `pyenv install <VERSION>`. For example, suppose you wanted to install Python `3.6.4`, you would run `pyenv install 3.6.4`.

You can switch between Python versions using `pyenv local <VERSION>`. For example, if you wanted to switch to Python version `2.7.17` you would run `pyenv local 2.7.17`. This will create a `.python-version` file that controls which Python version is the default in your project.

If you want to setup a [custom dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#use-a-custom-dockerfile) so that you don't have to repeat the process, here's how your `.gitpod.Dockerfile` could look like:

```dockerfile
# You could use `gitpod/workspace-full` as well.
FROM gitpod/workspace-python

RUN pyenv install 3.11 \
    && pyenv global 3.11
```

## [Start tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks)

You can start building your project when, or even [before](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) you start your Gitpod workspace. Are you using a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies? If so, add this to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) to automatically pre-install all dependencies when starting a workspace:

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    command: python3 main.py
```

## Linting

You can <a class="no-nowrap" href="https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server#configuration">create a `setup.cfg` or a `pycodestyle.cfg` in the project root</a> and [adjust pycodestyle](http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#configuration) rules there like this:

```toml
[pycodestyle]
ignore = E226,E302,E41
max-line-length = 160
statistics = True
```

You'll need to refresh the browser in order to update these rule. [Source](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/640#issuecomment-506622491).

## VSCode Extensions

While the most popular Python VSCode extensions are built into Gitpod, here are a few "nice to have" extensions that you can use as well.

### ARepl for Python

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="ARepl extension example" src="/images/docs/AReplExample.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>ARepl extension example</figcaption>
</figure>

ARepl for Python is helpful for constantly checking your code and debugging.
To install this extension for your repository, add the following to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml):

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - almenon.arepl
```

### Python Test Explorer

![Python test explorer example](../../../static/images/docs/python_Test_In_Gitpod.png)
Easily test your python extensions with the Python Test Explorer.
To add this to your repository add the following to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml)

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - littlefoxteam.vscode-python-test-adapter@0.3.16:tZ/6xOSSdKUaq6JCUVkD+A==
```

## GUI Applications with wxPython

To install wxPython to your repository please add the following to your [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image). If you don't have one, simply run [`gp init`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) and commit the two generated files.

```dockerfile
# This will pull the official Gitpod `vnc` image
# which has much of what you need to start
FROM gitpod/workspace-full-vnc

USER gitpod

# Install wxPython dependencies
RUN sudo apt-get -q update && \
    sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -yq freeglut3-dev python3.7-dev libpython3.7-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libnotify-dev libsdl2-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libxtst-dev libgtk2.0-dev && \
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install wxPython
RUN pip3 install -U -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-18.04/ wxPython
```

Here is a corresponding [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) example:

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile

# This will expose all necessary ports needed for your VNC image
ports:
  - port: 6080
    onOpen: open-preview
  - port: 5900
    onOpen: ignore
  - port: 35900
    onOpen: ignore

# This will make it so that on workspace start it will run a file called `app.py`
tasks:
  - command: python3 app.py
```

## Debugging

Here is a quick clip on how to automatically configure debugging for Python!

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Python debugging example" src="/images/docs/PythonDebug.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>Python debugging example</figcaption>
</figure>

So, basically in this video we:

1. First, open the Python file that we want to debug
2. Then, go to the debug menu and select "Add Configuration..."
3. Next, in the dropdown choose "Python"
4. Next, choose "Python File" as the debug configuration
5. Finally, start debugging your Python program!

You can also create the Python debug configuration file manually

To start debugging your Python application in Gitpod, please create a new directory called `.theia/`, and inside add a file called `launch.json`, finally, add the following to it:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: Current File",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${file}",
      "console": "internalConsole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, simply open the Python file you want to debug, open the Debug panel (in the left vertical toolbar, click the icon with the crossed-out-spider), and click the green "Run" button.

<br>

To see a basic repository with Python debugging enabled, please check out [gitpod-io/Gitpod-Python-Debug](https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-Python-Debug):

# R in Gitpod

To work with R in Gitpod, you will need to properly configure your repository. Here is how to do it.

## Installing R

First, you'll probably want to install R itself. To do this, add a new file to your repository called [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), and add the following content to it:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

RUN brew install R
```

Next, create a Gitpod configuration file called [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) (you can also simply run `gp init` and Gitpod will generate the file), and reference the above Dockerfile in it like so:

```yml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

Then commit and push both files to your repository. After that, every new Gitpod workspace created for your project will have R pre-installed.

## VSCode Extensions

### R Extension

![R extension](../../../static/images/docs/RGitpod.png)
To install the R extension to your repository, add the following to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file:

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - Ikuyadeu.r@1.2.1:z5vr1v1bfS++U/aHLSXQ6Q==
```

Here is a minimal example of [R running in Gitpod](https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-R). You can try it here:

</script>

# Ruby in Gitpod

It's relatively easy to set up your Ruby project in Gitpod.

## Ruby Versions

As of this writing, Gitpod comes with Ruby 3.1 pre-installed in the [gitpod/workspace-full](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full).

To use a different Ruby version, you can [change the base image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#configure-a-public-docker-image) to one of the following:

- [gitpod/workspace-ruby-2](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-ruby-2)
- [gitpod/workspace-ruby-3.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-ruby-3.0)

These images are automatically updated every week with the latest ruby patch versions.

To use a fixed version, you may use a [custom Dockerfile](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#configure-a-custom-dockerfile).

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full
USER gitpod

# Install Ruby version 2.7.6 and set it as default
RUN _ruby_version=ruby-2.7.6 \
    && printf "rvm_gems_path=/home/gitpod/.rvm\n" > ~/.rvmrc \
    && bash -lc "rvm reinstall ${_ruby_version} && \
                 rvm use ${_ruby_version} --default" \
    && printf "rvm_gems_path=/workspace/.rvm" > ~/.rvmrc \
    && printf "{ rvm use \$(rvm current); } >/dev/null 2>&1\n" >> "$HOME/.bashrc.d/70-ruby"
```

> 💡 Explanation: Gitpod initially [sets up RVM](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/481f7600b725e0ab507fbf8377641a562a475625/chunks/lang-ruby/Dockerfile#L11-L26) in `/home/gitpod/.rvm`, but then later switches the RVM configuration directory to `/workspace/.rvm`, so that any user-made changes (like installing new gems) are persisted within a Gitpod workspace. However, during the Dockerfile build, the `/workspace` directory doesn't exist yet, so we temporarily reset RVM's configuration directory to `/home/gitpod/.rvm`.

## Example Repositories

Here are a few Ruby example projects that are already automated with Gitpod:

## VSCode Extensions

Here are a few useful extensions that you'll likely want to install in your Ruby project.

### [Ruby Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connorshea.vscode-ruby-test-adapter)

With the Ruby test explorer, you can run unit tests from within the Gitpod UI.
![Ruby test explorer example](../../../static/images/docs/ruby_test_ui.png)
To add this extension to your repository, simply add these lines to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) configuration file:

```YAML
vscode:
  extensions:
    - connorshea.vscode-ruby-test-adapter@0.9.0
    - hbenl.vscode-test-explorer@2.21.1
```

## Ruby On Rails

So, you want to write your cool new Ruby On Rails application in Gitpod? Well, here is an idea of how to do it. Please take a look at our [minimal Rails example](https://github.com/gitpod-io/Gitpod-Ruby-On-Rails) running in Gitpod:

# Rust in Gitpod

Welcome, Rustacean!

Rust is a first-class language in Gitpod, and we believe that Gitpod is a great tool for Rust projects. Some of Gitpod's core developers frequently work with Rust code (in Gitpod), and several key components of Gitpod are written in Rust:

- The fantastic language support is provided by the [rls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls)
- The blazing-fast workspace search is powered by [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

## Rust Version

Gitpod always comes with the latest available Rust toolchain pre-installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). (As of this writing, the Rust version is `1.66.0`.

You can also use `rustup` yourself in Gitpod in order to switch to a different Rust version, or to install extra components. See [the rustup book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/index.html) to learn more about `rustup` itself.

Note: If you try to use `rustup` in your repository's [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), you might get the following error:

```
/bin/sh: rustup command not found
```

To fix this, simply wrap the `rustup` command in a login Bash shell, like so:

```dockerfile
RUN bash -cl "rustup toolchain install nightly"
```

You can override this default by committing a `rustup-toolchain` file in the root of your repository. Say for example you need the nightly compiler for March 4th, 2020, you would create a `rustup-toolchain` file and add the following

```text
nightly-2020-03-04
```

which will set the required Rust version and if you commit the file into source control it will set the default nightly version across all workspaces.

## Example Repositories

Here are a few Rust example projects that are already automated with Gitpod:

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

</div>

## VSCode Extensions

The most popular Rust VSCode extensions are already pre-installed in Gitpod. But here are a few "nice to have" extensions you may choose to install as well.

In order to install one of these extensions for your repository, simply head to Gitpod's [Extensions panel](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-extensions) (find it in the IDE's left vertical menu), then search for the desired extension by name, and install it for your project. This will add an entry to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file that ensures all future Gitpod workspaces for your repository will already have this extension pre-installed.

### Rust Test Explorer

![Rust test explorer example](../../../static/images/docs/rustTest.png)
<br>
<br>
The Rust Test Explorer makes it easy to run Rust tests.

### Crates

> **_Note: This extension outputs emojis by default if the crate version is set at the latest. You can disable this by using `crates.upToDateDecorator` option in your preferences_** > <br>

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="A crates extension demo" src="/images/docs/cratesDemo.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>A crates extension demo</figcaption>
</figure>

The VSCode extension Crates makes it easier to manage your Cargo dependency versions.

### Search Crates.io

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="An example of search crates.io extension" src="/images/docs/searchCratesio.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>An example of search crates.io extension</figcaption>
</figure>

Do you have an idea of a library you want to use but don't know the version well just type in the name of the library and Search Crates.io will get the version.

### Better TOML

![TOML Syntax highlighting example](../../../static/images/docs/feature_syntax_highlight.png)

Better TOML adds syntax highlighting to your `Cargo.toml`.

## Cross-compiling with MUSL

To cross-compile with MUSL in Gitpod, you can:

- Run `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, for example in your [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image)
- Then, build with `cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`

To learn more, see [MUSL support for fully static binaries](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html).

## Debugging

In this section we will show you how to configure your project for debugging in Gitpod.

First, before we get to that we need to get some prerequisites set-up.

First we'll install the needed extension. If you haven't already, head over to Gitpod's [Extensions panel](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-extensions) (left vertical menu in the IDE) and search for an extension called `Native Debug` by webfreak. When you see it, click to install it for your project.

The next prerequisite is a Docker configuration.

If you already have a [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) just add the following:

```dockerfile
RUN sudo apt-get -q update \
    && sudo apt-get install -yq \
        libpython3.6 \
        rust-lldb \
    && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENV RUST_LLDB=/usr/bin/lldb-8
```

If not there are two steps. First, create a file called `.gitpod.Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

USER gitpod

RUN sudo apt-get -q update \
    && sudo apt-get install -yq \
        libpython3.6 \
        rust-lldb \
    && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENV RUST_LLDB=/usr/bin/lldb-8
```

Next, add the following to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file:

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

Now that's out of the way, here is a video on how to configure the debug configuration

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Rust debugging example" src="/images/docs/RustDebug.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>Rust debugging example</figcaption>
</figure>

So, basically in this video we:

1. Go to the debug menu and select "Add Configuration..."
2. Next, in the dropdown choose "GDB: Launch Program"
3. Go to the `Cargo.toml` file and find the name of the program.
4. Modify the target field and change it to `${workspaceFolder}/target/debug/<PROGRAM_NAME>` where `<PROGRAM_NAME>` is the name of the program under the name field in the `Cargo.toml` file.
5. Add another property to the created file called `preLaunchTask` and set it to "cargo"
6. Go to the terminal menu and click configure tasks
7. Select cargo build from the menu that pops up
8. change the tag `type` to `command`
9. change the tag `subcommand` to `args` and the value to `["build"]`
10. Next remove the `problemMatcher` field.
11. Add a field called `type` and set it to `process`
12. Add a field called `label` and set it to `cargo`
13. Go to the Rust file you want to debug
14. Add a breakpoint or two
15. Go back to the debug menu that has the crossed out spider
16. Click the green run button.
17. Finally, start debugging your Rust program!

You can also create the Rust debug configuration file manually

To start debugging your Rust application in Gitpod, please create a new directory called `.theia/`, and inside add a file called `launch.json`, add the following to it:

```json
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "gdb",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug Rust Code",
      "preLaunchTask": "cargo",
      "target": "${workspaceFolder}/target/debug/rust_debug",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "valuesFormatting": "parseText"
    }
  ]
}
```

Next create another file in the same `.theia/` directory called `tasks.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "command": "cargo",
      "args": ["build"],
      "type": "process",
      "label": "cargo"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, simply open the Rust file you want to debug, add some breakpoints, and open the Debug panel (in the left vertical toolbar, click the icon with the crossed-out-spider), and click the green "Run" button.

<br>

# Scala in Gitpod

Welcome, Scala programmer. Today we will show you how to configure Gitpod for your project.

## Installing Scala

First, you'll probably want to install Scala. To do this, add a new file to your repository called [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), and add the following content to it:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

RUN brew install scala
```

Additionally create a file called [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and add the following:

```YAML
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

Now commit both files into source control.

### What are these files for?

Let's break this down. First, in `.gitpod.Dockerfile`, we declare `FROM gitpod/workspace-full` to have your project use Gitpod's default workspace image (recommended). You can use other images too, but some Gitpod features might not work as well with untested images.

Next, we declare `RUN brew install scala`. This simply installs Scala into the workspace image via HomeBrew.

Then, we register our custom Dockerfile in Gitpod's configuration file `.gitpod.yml`, so that Gitpod knows it should pick it up and build it on-the-fly when booting up new workspaces.

Finally, please note that these changes will only take effect in new workspaces. To try out your new automated dev setup, simply commit both files; push them to GitHub; and then open a new Gitpod workspace for your repository. 🚀

## Using the Ammonite REPL

![The Ammonite REPL in action](../../../static/images/docs/AmmoniteRepl.png)

To install the [Ammonite REPL](https://ammonite.io/) in Gitpod, you must add the following to our previously-created [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image):

```dockerfile
RUN sudo sh -c '(echo "#!/usr/bin/env sh" && curl -L https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite/releases/download/2.0.4/2.13-2.0.4) > /usr/local/bin/amm && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amm'
```

Then commit the changes and push to your repository. Finally, when you open a new workspace, you will be able to type `amm` in the terminal, and behold a super cool Scala REPL in your workspace!

## Building projects with sbt

To use [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) (simple build tool) in Gitpod, you can add the following to that [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) we created:

```dockerfile
RUN brew install sbt
```

As usual, commit and push the changes, and `sbt` will be installed in all future workspaces.

## Managing Scala versions with scalaenv

Say your project needs a specific Scala version. You can use [scalaenv](https://github.com/scalaenv/scalaenv), a version manager for Scala, to switch between different Scala versions. But first, we must install `scalaenv`. As usual, we need to change our [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), by adding this to it:

```dockerfile
RUN brew install scalaenv
```

Then, say you need Scala version `2.12.11`, you would add the following line as well:

```dockerfile
RUN scalaenv install scala-2.12.11 && scalaenv global scala-2.12.11
```

## Using coursier, an artifact fetcher for Scala

[coursier](https://get-coursier.io/) is useful for building certain Scala projects and installing different tools.

```dockerfile
RUN brew install coursier/formulas/coursier
```

(Don't forget to commit and push this change!)

## Formatting Scala code with scalafmt

To install [scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) for your repository, add the following to your [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image):

```dockerfile
RUN sudo env "PATH=$PATH" coursier bootstrap org.scalameta:scalafmt-cli_2.12:2.4.2 \
  -r sonatype:snapshots \
  -o /usr/local/bin/scalafmt --standalone --main org.scalafmt.cli.Cli
```

Then to format your code simply run `scalafmt`!

## Putting it all together

A full example of a [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) configured for Scala could look something like:

```dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

RUN sudo sh -c '(echo "#!/usr/bin/env sh" && curl -L https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite/releases/download/2.0.4/2.13-2.0.4) > /usr/local/bin/amm && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amm'

RUN brew install scala coursier/formulas/coursier sbt scalaenv

RUN sudo env "PATH=$PATH" coursier bootstrap org.scalameta:scalafmt-cli_2.12:2.4.2 \
  -r sonatype:snapshots \
  -o /usr/local/bin/scalafmt --standalone --main org.scalafmt.cli.Cli

RUN scalaenv install scala-2.12.11 && scalaenv global scala-2.12.11
```

You will notice that all the `brew install` commands are on the same line. We recommend grouping similar commands together to minimize the number of [Docker layers](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#minimize-the-number-of-layers).

Additionally, your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file should still look like this:

```YAML
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

## VSCode Extensions

### Scala Syntax (official)

![Scala Syntax demo](../../../static/images/docs/scala-syntax.png)

Scala Syntax adds basic syntax highlighting for Scala and `sbt` files.

To get it, open Gitpod's **Extensions** panel (left vertical menu in the IDE), then search for "Scala Syntax", and install it "for this project". Then, commit the automatic `.gitpod.yml` change that was made by Gitpod.

### Metals

![An example of the metals in Gitpod](../../../static/images/docs/metals-demo.png)

Metals adds helpful Scala features to Gitpod, for example, advanced autocompletion and debugging support just to name a few. Although to use it you must also have the previously mentioned Scala Syntax.

To get it, open Gitpod's **Extensions** panel (left vertical menu in the IDE), then search for "Scala Metals", and install it "for this project". Then, commit the automatic `.gitpod.yml` change that was made by Gitpod.

Boom! You're done! (Just a reminder, don't forget to push the changes.)

## Debugging Scala code

To debug Scala code in Gitpod you should use the Metals extension which we just went over. Here is an example of Scala Debugging in action:

# Svelte in Gitpod

To work with Svelte in Gitpod, you will need to properly configure your repository. Here is how to do that, assuming that you're using the official sveltejs [template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template) which uses Rollup:

## Create a .gitpod.yml

Start by creating a `.gitpod.yml` file in the root of your project and add the following to it:

```yml
tasks:
  - init: npm install
    command: npm run dev

ports:
  - port: 5000
    onOpen: open-preview
  - port: 35729
    onOpen: ignore
```

After committing and pushing this file to your repository, start a new Gitpod workspace. You'll see that Gitpod will automatically install the dependencies; start the dev server; and open a preview on the side for port `5000`.

![Sveltejs Template in Gitpod](../../../static/images/docs/svelte-template-in-gitpod.png)

## Making Live Reload work

In order to make live reload work we need to add a bit of configuration as specified below:

- Setup an environment variable called `CLIENT_URL` in the `.gitpod.yml` config file as shown below please make sure that you set it up before the task which starts the dev server(which is `npm run dev` in this case):

  ```bash
  - init: npm install
      command: |
        export CLIENT_URL="$(gp url 35729)/livereload.js?snipver=1&port=443"
        npm run dev
  ```

- Pass the value of `CLIENT_URL` environment variable to the `rollup-plugin-livereload` in `rollup-config.js` inside of the `plugins` array as shown:
  ```js
  plugins: [
    !production &&
      livereload({
        watch: "public",
        clientUrl: process.env.CLIENT_URL,
      }),
  ];
  ```
  This will set `CLIENT_URL` to the workspace url of port `35729` (default port for livereload in Gitpod).

## VSCode Extensions

### Svelte for VS Code

Svelte for VS Code Provides syntax highlighting and rich IntelliSense for Svelte components in VS Code, utilising the [svelte language server](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/language-server).

To add this extension to your repository, simply head to Gitpod’s [Extensions panel](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-extensions) (find it in the IDE’s left vertical menu), then search for the desired extension by name, and install it for your project. This will add an entry to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file that ensures all future Gitpod workspaces for your repository will already have this extension pre-installed.

https://github.com/gitpod-io/sveltejs-template repo is a working example of the config described above <span aria-hidden="true">👆</span>.

# Vue.js in Gitpod

To work with Vue.js in Gitpod, you will need to properly configure your repository. Here is how to do it.

## Example Repositories

Here are a few Vue.js example projects that are already automated with Gitpod:

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

</div>

## Vue-CLI

To install the Vue.js command-line interface in your current workspace run the following

```bash
npm i -g vue-cli
```

To install globally across all workspaces add the following to your [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image)

```dockerfile
RUN npm i -g vue-cli
```

> Please note: If you don't already have one please run [`gp init`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#init) which should generate two files [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and [.gitpod.Dockerfile](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image)

## VSCode Extensions

### Vetur

![Vetur extension](../../../static/images/docs/Vetur.png)

Vetur provides syntax highlighting, snippets, Emmet support, linting/error checking, auto-formatting, and auto-complete for Vue files.

To add this extension to your repository add the following to your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml)

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - octref.vetur@0.23.0:TEzauMObB6f3i2JqlvrOpA==
```

For projects that already have a [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml), you can skip the first part and just add the provided snippet.

section: learn-gitpod
title: Context URL
---

<script context="module">
  export const prerender = true;
</script>

# Context URL

Gitpod understands a variety of common situations you experience as part of your development workflow and automates repetitive tasks, giving you time to focus on more impactful work.

The context is determined by a Gitpod URL's [_anchor_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL), i.e. the link provided at the end of the `#` character in the `gitpod.io/#` URL.

Regardless of the context, Gitpod performs the tasks configured in `.gitpod.yml` if this configuration file is available for a given repository.

Gitpod is aware of the following contexts:

- [Context URL](#Context-URL)
  - [Repository Context](#repository-context)
  - [Branch and Commit Contexts](#branch-and-commit-contexts)
  - [Issue Context](#issue-context)
  - [Pull/Merge Request Context](#pullmerge-request-context)

Please note, these contexts are supported for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. This also includes Self-Hosted installations of these git providers, where available.

## Repository Context

To start a new workspace, you prefix your repository URL with `gitpod.io/#`. E.g. [gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website).

This is the most basic context and Gitpod simply checks out the default branch and opens the Welcome screen once the workspace is ready.

An example URL for the repository context is:

```
gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website
```

## Branch and Commit Contexts

The branch and commit contexts are very similar to the repository context described above. When you open a new workspace for a given branch or commit, Gitpod automatically checks out that branch or commit, allowing you to browse the repository on that branch or at the time of the given commit.

An example URL for the branch context is:

```
gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/tree/my-branch
```

An example URL for the commit SHA context is:

```
gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/commit/f5d4eb4cd3859a760ac613598e840b94e8094649
```

## Issue Context

The fastest way to work on an issue is to start a Gitpod workspace with an issue context. Gitpod automatically creates a local branch based on the following pattern:

```text
<your-username>/<issue-title>-<issue-number>
```

This branch is based on the most recent commit in your project's default branch.

You can commit your changes with the `git` command line interface or use the _Source Control_ panel on the left side of the editor. From there, you can also create a new pull/merge request without leaving Gitpod.

An example URL for the issue context is:

```
gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/issues/470
```

## Pull/Merge Request Context

> **Note:** Currently pull-request based context URLs are only supported by [GitHub authentication](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/authentication/github) as a [Gitpod authentication method](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/authentication).

When Gitpod recognizes a pull or merge request context, it knows you most likely have one of two intentions:

- As a reviewer, provide PR/MR feedback
- As an author, process feedback and update the code

In either case, Gitpod automatically performs the following tasks for you:

1. Starts a workspace with the correct branch checked out
1. Opens the PR/MR review panel where you can see and contribute to existing conversations
1. Displays a list of files changed as part of that PR/MR
1. Enables you to leave comments right within individual files (yep, no need to switch between the code and the PR/MR in your browser)

In addition, Gitpod lets you merge a PR/MR. Once merged, you close the browser tab and move on to your next task - in a new, ephemeral developer environment 🎉.

An example URL for the pull/merge request context is:

```
gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website/pull/494
```

<script context="module">
  export const prerender = true;
</script>

# .gitpod.yml

A workspace gets configured through a `.gitpod.yml` file, located at the root of your project, written in YAML syntax. Here's an example:

```yaml
# Commands to start on workspace startup
tasks:
  - name: Setup & Build
    before: yarn global add express
    init: yarn install
    command: yarn build

# Ports to expose on workspace startup
ports:
  - port: 3000
    onOpen: open-preview
    name: Website
    description: Website Preview
```

To see a full reference of all available properties, please refer to the [`.gitpod.yml reference`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) page.

`youtube: E95oV_iqUtI`

## How to provide the .gitpod.yml config file

In order to tell Gitpod how to prepare a dev environment for your project, you check in a `.gitpod.yml` file into the root of your repository. This way you can
version your workspace configuration together with your code. If, for example, you need to go back to
an old branch that required a different configuration, Gitpod will start with the correct configuration, since that
bit of configuration is part of your codebase.

## Generate Your Gitpod Config File

The quickest way to create a `.gitpod.yml` file is with the `gp` CLI. In the terminal of a Gitpod workspace, type:

```sh
gp init
```

This generates example content you can adjust to meet your needs.

Alternatively, you can use the interactive mode with `gp init -i`. It will ask you about the different configuration options, generate the `.gitpod.yml` file and open it in an editor tab so you can review and extend as necessary.

Gitpod provides auto-complete, hover info and validation for the `.gitpod.yml` file so you get instant feedback and can rest assure your configuration is valid.

## See it in action

To test your `.gitpod.yml` file, you need to commit and push the file to your repository and open a new workspace either by using the [Gitpod extension](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension#browser-extension) or prefixing your repo URL with `https://gitpod.io/#`.

If you don't want to have multiple commits as you're testing and making changes to your `.gitpod.yml`, you can make changes from a new branch.

# One workspace per task

On any given day, you may be involved in tasks such as the following:

- Implement a new feature
- Fix a bug
- Review a pull/merge request
- Pair-program with a team member
- Browse an open source project's source code

For each of these tasks, you start a clean, ephemeral Gitpod workspace. You can even start **multiple workspaces in parallel**. For example, while you're working on a feature, you can start a second workspace to review a production hotfix. When the review is complete, you close the browser tab of that workspace and continue to work on your feature. This works for any GitLab, GitHub or Bitbucket project.

You can learn more about the [Life of a workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-lifecycle

## Gitpod vs. local development

A Gitpod workspace is similar to your local developer environment, except for two key differentiators:

1. It is configured as code
1. It is ephemeral and only lives for as long as you work on a task

### Configuration vs. manual setup

Your project's `.gitpod.yml` and optional `.gitpod.Dockerfile` files control what tools will be available in your Gitpod workspace. Both files are version-controlled and let you monitor changes to the developer environment over time. There is no longer a need to `@channel` in your team's communication software to tell everyone to upgrade their version of Node.js, only to find out that some people were on vacation and didn't see the message.

### Ephemeral vs. long-lived

Thanks to the fact that Gitpod workspaces are configured as code, you can start and stop them as frequently as you want. You know that each workspace has the tools it needs and even more importantly, has the latest code from your default branch checked out! You no longer have to pull the latest default branch a few times per day because each time you start a new workspace, it has the latest code already available.

</script>

# Gitpod CLI

Gitpod supports a command line interface that is available in each workspace terminal called `gp`:

```text
Command line interface for Gitpod

Usage:
  gp [command]

Available Commands:
  docs                Open Gitpod Documentation in default browser
  env                 Controls user-defined, persistent environment variables.
  help                Help about any command
  info                Display workspace info, such as its ID, class, etc.
  init                Create a Gitpod configuration for this project.
  open                Opens a file in Gitpod
  ports               Interact with workspace ports.
  preview             Opens a URL in the IDE's preview
  rebuild             Re-builds the workspace image (useful to debug a workspace custom image)
  snapshot            Take a snapshot of the current workspace
  stop                Stop current workspace
  sync-await          Awaits an event triggered using gp sync-done
  sync-done           Notifies the corresponding gp sync-await calls that this event has happened
  tasks               Interact with workspace tasks
  timeout             Interact with workspace timeout configuration
  top                 Display workspace resource (CPU and memory usage)
  url                 Prints the URL of this workspace
  version             Prints the version of the CLI

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for gp

Use "gp [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## init

Gitpod workspaces can be configured - see [Configuring Workspaces](/docs/configure) for more details. `gp init` generates a default `.gitpod.yml` file. You can customize it to match your requirements.

Alternatively, `gp init -i` is an interactive guide which helps create the `.gitpod.yml` configuration file based on a few questions you answer.

Example to start a interactive guide of `.gitpod.yml` configuration file:

```sh
gp init -i
```

## open

Modern editors/IDE's support command line tooling to open a file (e.g. VS Code `code foo.txt`). In Gitpod, this can be done using `gp open <filename>`.
We also added common aliases for `gp open`: `code` and `open`.

Example to open the `README.md` file in the current directory:

```sh
gp open README.md
```

## preview

`gp preview` opens a URL. The default is to show the URL in a preview pane within the editor or IDE directly. Alternatively, you can show the preview a new tab with the `--external` flag.

Make sure you provide a valid URL, i.e. including the protocol. For example, http://localhost:8080.

You can also use `gp preview <url> --external` to open the URL in a new browser tab.

Example opening a gitpod workspace port 3000 as a tab using `gp url` and `gp preview`:

```sh
gp preview $(gp url 3000) --external
```

## url

Gitpod workspaces can expose services to the internet. `gp url` provides the URL which points to a service served from a Gitpod workspace. For example `gp url 8080` prints the URL which points to the service listening on port 8080 in this current workspace.

You can combine the `preview` and the `url` command to open a certain path instead of the default URL.

For instance:

```sh
gp preview $(gp url 3000)/my/path/index.html
```

If you put this into the `.gitpod.yml` to open the a certain page on startup, make sure you [ignore the default action](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports) when the port opens.

## env

With `gp env API_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com` you can set an `API_ENDPOINT` environment variable that is accessible for this project, even if you stop the workspace and start a new one.

To delete or unset an environment variable, you use `gp env -u API_ENDPOINT`.

Please refer to the help output provided by `gp env --help` for more use cases of the `gp env` command.

For instance, you can use following to get your all Gitpod environment variables:

```sh
gp env
```

## sync-await

In situations where you work with multiple terminals and one depends on a task in another terminal to complete, `gp sync-await <name>` waits until you call `gp sync-done <name>` in another terminal.

See [Start Tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks#wait-for-commands-to-complete) for a real-world example.

## sync-done

To notify a `gp sync-await <name>` call (see previous chapter), you can call `gp sync-done <name>`.

A common use case is the following where we have three terminals:

- Terminal 1: A build process takes several minutes to complete. At the end, you call `gp sync-done build`.
- Terminal 2: You use `gp sync-await build && npm run start-database` to wait for the build to complete before you start a database
- Terminal 3: You use `gp sync-await build && npm run dev` to wait for the build to complete before you start the dev server.

See [Start Tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks#wait-for-commands-to-complete) for a real-world example.

## snapshot

For sharing a complete clone of a workspace with others, `gp snapshot` is basically the CLI method for getting a snapshot URL. To learn more about snapshots, see [Collaboration & Sharing of Workspaces](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration#sharing-snapshots)

```sh
gp snapshot
```

## stop

`gp stop` is the CLI method of stopping a workspace.

Example to stop the current gitpod workspace using gitpod CLI:

```sh
gp stop
```

## tasks

Programmatically view and interact with workspace tasks as defined in the project's [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml). Useful when using the command line, such as ssh'ing into a workspace or after accidentally losing view of a terminal and it's output.

### list

Returns a table-formatted list of tasks, their name, state and the ID of the terminal in which the task is executed.

> **Tip**: You can see the task you are currently attached to highlighted in green.

```sh
gp tasks list
```

Use `gp tasks list --no-color` to disable colors for the output. It also respects the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) & `GP_NO_COLOR` environment variable.

### attach

Creates a connection from a user terminal to a given workspace's task terminal. The session is interactive. Once attached, both stdin and stdout are streamed between the user and the remote terminal. Allowing the user to run commands directly in the task terminal.

Run without arguments to get a selection prompt. When only one task is running, attach will skip the prompt and automatically connect.

```sh
gp tasks attach
```

Alternatively, specify the `Terminal ID` that you can see with `gp tasks list`:

```sh
gp tasks attach <id>
```

### stop

Interrupts one or more running tasks and automatically closes their terminals. Useful when you don't need a certain task anymore, when authoring the [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file or when you start a workspace for projects with several tasks but you don't need them and want to save time and resources.

Run without arguments to get a selection prompt. Only running tasks will be offered as a choice.

```sh
gp tasks stop
```

Specify the `Terminal ID` that you can see with `gp tasks list`.

```sh
gp tasks stop <id>
```

Run with the `--all` flag to stop all running tasks.

```sh
gp tasks stop --all
```

## timeout

Interact with workspace timeout configuration. You can learn more in [Life of a Workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-lifecycle).

```sh
gp timeout show
```

> **Note:** You can only have one workspace with extended timeout at a time.

The default timeout, and the ability to extend a workspace timeout depends on your [billing configuration](/docs/configure/billing).

### set

Sets the current workspace's timeout to the given value. The value must be a positive integer followed by a unit of time. The unit of time can be one of `m`, `h` for minutes and hours, respectively. The maximum workspace timeout is 24 hours.

<!--
Technically, Following ones are also valid:

* `gp timeout set 300m`
* `gp timeout set 24h`

=> But Let's use minutes for public interaction as it's the most common use case.

-->

```sh
gp timeout set 300m
```

### show

Shows the current workspace's timeout.

```sh
gp timeout show
```

### extend

Extends the current workspace timeout from the default, or currently set value to 180 minutes.

```sh
gp timeout extend
```

## info

Displays information about the current [workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces) (such as the workspace ID and URL) and also the [workspace class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes).

```sh
gp info
```

Use `gp info --json` to get the output in JSON format for programmatic use in (e.g. in shell scripts).

## ports

Provides a way to manage a workspace's ports. Applies to both: ports defined in [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and ports that are undeclared but are opened during the lifetime of the workspace.

### list

Outputs a table-formatted list of ports along with their status, URL, name and description.

```sh
gp ports list
```

Use `gp ports list --no-color` to disable colors for the output. It also respects the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) & `GP_NO_COLOR` environment variable.

### expose

In Gitpod, services/servers running on a port need to be _exposed_ before they become accessible from the internet. This process only works with services listening on `0.0.0.0` and not just `localhost`.
Sometimes it is not possible to make a server listen on `0.0.0.0`, e.g. because it is not your code and there are simply no means of configuration.

In that case, `gp ports expose <port>` can be used to forward all traffic form a socket listing on all network interfaces to your process listening on localhost only.

```sh
gp ports expose <port>
```

### await

When writing tasks to be executed on workspace start, one sometimes wants to wait for an http service to be available. `gp ports await` does that.

Here's an example that will open a certain path once a service is a available:

```sh
gp ports await 3000 && gp preview $(gp url 3000)/my/path/index.html
```

### visibility

You can change a port's visibility to make it only available for **users with workspace access** (`private`) or **everyone who knows the port's URL** (`public`). A port's default visibility is always `private`, unless configured differently from within [`.gitpod.yml`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml#portsnvisibility).

Here's an example which will make port `3000` public:

```sh
gp ports visibility 3000:public
```

Here's an example which will make port `3000` private:

```sh
gp ports visibility 3000:private
```

## top

Displays the current workspace's class info along with the used and available CPU and memory.

```sh
gp top
```

- Use `gp top --json` to get the output in JSON format for programmatic use in (e.g. in shell scripts).

- Use `gp top --no-color` to disable colors for the output. It also respects the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) & `GP_NO_COLOR` environment variable.

## docs

Opens the Gitpod documentation in a new browser tab.

```sh
gp docs
```

## rebuild

> `gp rebuild` is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7671).

Runs a debug workspace inside an existing Gitpod workspace. You can use this to quickly iterate on/debug your [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) properties such as [tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) or a [custom workspace image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image).

```sh
gp rebuild
```

# Gitpod public API

> Access Tokens are currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/10798).

The Gitpod Public API grants direct access to Gitpod data for use cases such as integration into other 3rd party applications.

## Authentication

To authenticate requests, the Gitpod API utilises [Access Token](/docs/configure/user-settings/access-tokens). In the [Gitpod Settings](https://gitpod.io/tokens), you can view and manage your PAT Tokens (_Private Beta_).

Keep in mind that your access tokens have a lot of power, so protect them carefully! Avoid disclosing your private Access Tokens in areas that are open to the public, such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

To Authenticate you will need to pass an Access Token as an Authorization request header bearer token in the format `Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`.

Example cURL command:

```bash title="cURL"
curl 'https://api.gitpod.io/gitpod.experimental.v1.TeamsService/ListTeams' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --data '{}'
```

## API Reference

## Resource: Workspaces

### List all workspaces

Lists all the workspaces belongs to the authenticated user. Currently, it returns only the first page of the results.

## API language clients

### Go

The following is an example of how to use the Go client library with the Public API for retrieving teams data. Replace the environment variable `PERSONAL_PAT` with your own personal access token, for example: `export PERSONAL_PAT=<your-personal-pat>`

```go
// Download the helper library using go get -u github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/components/public-api/go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/bufbuild/connect-go"
    "github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/components/public-api/go/client"
    v1 "github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/components/public-api/go/experimental/v1"
)

func main() {
    token := "<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"

    gitpod, err := client.New(client.WithCredentials(token))
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Failed to construct gitpod client %v", err)
        return
    }

    response, err := gitpod.Teams.ListTeams(context.Background(), connect.NewRequest(&v1.ListTeamsRequest{}))
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Failed to list teams %v", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "Retrieved teams %v", response.Msg.GetTeams())
}

## `additionalRepositories`

> additionalRepositories is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle). [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8623).

Defines additional source control repositories to clone and where the repository is cloned under `/workspaces`

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |
| -------- | --------- |
| `object` | `<empty>` |

</div>

**Demo**

<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend"><img src="https://gitpod-staging.com/button/open-in-gitpod.svg"/></a>

**Example**

```yaml
additionalRepositories:
  - url: https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend
    # checkoutLocation is optional and relative to /workspaces.
    # by default the location defaults to the repository name.
    checkoutLocation: backend
```

When the above configuration is defined then the following additional steps happen when Gitpod workspace is started:

1. If you open a workspace on a branch, Gitpod will clone the same-named branch in all repositories. If such a branch doesn’t exist Gitpod checks out the default branch.
1. The contents of the branch is cloned under `/workspaces/`
1. The contents of `https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend` is cloned to `/workspaces/backend`

After all of the source control repositories have been cloned then the `before`, `init` and `command` [tasks](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) are executed as per normal.

If you need to run commands (such as package installation or compilation) on the source control repositories which have been cloned then change your working directory to the use configured or default `checkoutLocation` location using the `before` task.

**Example**

```yaml
# example .gitpod.yml from https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-frontend
additionalRepositories:
  - url: https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend
    # checkoutLocation is optional and relative to /workspaces.
    # by default the location defaults to the repository name.
    checkoutLocation: backend

tasks:
  - name: backend
    # change working directory as per configured in `checkoutLocation`
    # which is configured above as `/workspaces/backend`
    before: |
      cd ../backend
    init: |
      echo npm install
    command: |
      echo npm run dev

    # changing of working directory is not required as these tasks will
    # by default by executed in `/workspaces/demo-multi-repo-frontend`
  - name: frontend
    init: |
      echo npm install
      echo npm run build
    command: |
      echo npm run dev
```

## `checkoutLocation`

Define where Gitpod checks out the project's code, relative to `/workspace`.

In most cases, this is not needed. If you work on an older Go project, please see the [Go Language Page](/docs/introduction/languages/go) for more details.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default      |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `string` | `/workspace` |

</div>

**Example**

```yaml
checkoutLocation: "go/src/github.com/demo-apps/go-gin-app"
```

## `coreDump`

Define workspace core dump behavior.

For most cases, setting the `coreDump` property is not required. However, it can be a valuable feature to debug C++, or when debugging add-ons in Rust, Python, or node.js.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |
| -------- | --------- |
| `object` | `<empty>` |

</div>

**Example**

```yaml
coreDump:
  enabled: true
```

You can also set custom size values for the generated core files using the `softLimit` and `hardLimit` values (see example below). The setting `softLimit` configures the upper limit on the size of the core dump file that will be produced if a process receives a core dump signal, while `hardLimit` allows setting a hard limit to act as a ceiling for the soft limit.

```yaml
coreDump:
  enabled: true
  softLimit: <bytes>
  hardLimit: <bytes>
```

For more details, please see the [Linux man page for `getrlimit`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html)

## `gitConfig`

Define a workspace's git configuration as key-value pairs.

Please refer to https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_values for a list of accepted values.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |
| -------- | --------- |
| `object` | `<empty>` |

</div>

**Example**

```yaml
gitConfig:
  alias.st: status
  core.autocrlf: input
```

## `github`

Configure the [GitHub Gitpod](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io) app. At this time, the following configuration is used to configure [continuous prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) for GitHub repositories.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |
| -------- | --------- |
| `object` | `<empty>` |

</div>

**Example**

```yaml
github:
  prebuilds:
    master: true
    branches: true
    pullRequests: true
    pullRequestsFromForks: true
    addCheck: false
    addComment: false
    addBadge: true
```

### `prebuilds.addBadge`

Gitpod can modify the description of a pull request to add an “Open in Gitpod” button. This approach produces fewer GitHub notifications than [adding a comment](#prebuildsaddcomment), but can also create a concurrent editing conflict when the bot and a user try to edit the description of a pull request at the same time.

![An Open in Gitpod badge in a PR description](../../../static/images/docs/beta/references/gitpod-yml/references-gitpod-yml-github-badge.png)

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `false` |

</div>

### `prebuilds.addCheck`

Configure whether Gitpod registers itself as a status check to pull requests - much like a continuous integration system would do. By default a failing prebuild would not make the check fail. Set `prevent-merge-on-error` to block PR merging when prebuilds failed.

To learn more about status checks, please see the GitHub documentation [about status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).

![Gitpod status check in a pull request](../../../static/images/docs/beta/references/gitpod-yml/references-gitpod-yml-github-check.png)

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default                  | Values                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `string` | `prevent-merge-on-error` | `true`, `false`, `prevent-merge-on-error` |

</div>

### `prebuilds.addComment`

Gitpod can add a comment with an “Open in Gitpod” button to your pull requests. Alternatively, you could [add a badge](#prebuildsaddbadge) to the pull request's description.

![An Open in Gitpod badge in a PR comment](../../../static/images/docs/beta/references/gitpod-yml/references-gitpod-yml-github-comment.png)

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `false` |

</div>

### `prebuilds.addLabel`

Deprecated.

### `prebuilds.branches`

Define whether Gitpod creates prebuilds for all branches.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `false` |

</div>

### `prebuilds.master`

Define whether Gitpod creates prebuilds for the default branch.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  |

</div>

### `prebuilds.pullRequests`

Define whether Gitpod creates prebuilds for pull requests from the original repository.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  |

</div>

### `prebuilds.pullRequestsFromForks`

Define whether Gitpod creates prebuilds for pull requests from forks.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type      | Default |
| --------- | ------- |
| `boolean` | `false` |

</div>

## `image`

Define a custom Docker image to be used for workspaces. To learn more, please review [Custom Docker Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#configure-a-custom-dockerfile).

Public images are hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/gitpod/) and can be referenced by their name, e.g. `ubuntu:latest`.

To see a list of Gitpod-provided images, please see [gitpod-io/workspace-images](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images).

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type                 | Default                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `object` or `string` | `gitpod/workspace-full` |

</div>

**Examples**

_With a public image_

```yaml
image: ubuntu:latest
```

_With a custom image_

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

_With an optional context_

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile

```

### `image.file`

To define a custom Docker image, you can use the following configuration:

For a list of examples, please see https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |
| -------- | --------- |
| `string` | `<empty>` |

</div>

### `image.context`

Optionally, you can set the `image.context`. This is useful when you want to copy files into the Docker image. The [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#usage) describe this in more detail.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

Adds a description to the port, which will be shown as a column in the output of `gp ports list`.

You can find the port's description in the ports view table column, following the `Address` field (the same description can be found in the `Remote Explorer` as a tooltip [on hover] of the port).

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |
| -------- | --------- |
| `string` | `<empty>` |

</div>

### `ports[n].onOpen`

Define what to do when Gitpod detects a given port is being listened on.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   | Values                                                                  |
| -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string` | `<empty>` | `open-browser`,<br><br>`open-preview`,<br><br>`notify`,<br><br>`ignore` |

</div>

**Please note:** For JetBrains IDEs connected to Gitpod via [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) `open-preview` will behave exactly the same as `open-browser`, as there is no functionality for a web preview in the JetBrains IDE.

### `ports[n].port`

Define a single port or a range of ports, e.g. `3000-3100`.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type                 | Default   |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| `number` or `string` | `<empty>` |

</div>

### `ports[n].visibility`

Define whether to expose the port publicly or keep it private.

A public port allows you to share a URL for a given port with team members, for example if you want to get their feedback on a new feature you develop.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   | Values                     |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| `string` | `private` | `private`,<br><br>`public` |

</div>

## `tasks`

Define how Gitpod prepares & builds your project and how it can start the project's development server(s). To learn more, please visit [Start Tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks). Each array element opens in its own terminal.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type    | Default   |
| ------- | --------- |

</div>

### `tasks[n].init`

A shell command to run between `before` and the main `command`.

This task is executed only once. When you start a workspace that does not have a [prebuild](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds), `init` is executed at workspace start. When you start a workspace that has a prebuild, `init` executes as part of the prebuild, but does NOT execute again at workspace start.

This task is expected to terminate. If it fails, the `command` property will not be executed.

Learn more about [Start Tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) in the docs.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |

## `mainConfiguration`

> mainConfiguration is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle). [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8623).

Defines the repository with the main `.gitpod.yml` file and makes it possible to open the same workspace from any issue, branch or other context URL from any repository defined in a multi repository configuration.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |
| -------- | --------- |
| `string` | `<empty>` |

</div>

**Demo**

<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend"><img src="https://gitpod-staging.com/button/open-in-gitpod.svg"/></a>

### `vscode.extensions`

Define a list of extensions which should be installed for users of this workspace. The identifier of an extension is always `${publisher}.${name}`. For example: 'vscodevim.vim'.

Please note, Gitpod uses the [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/) to find extensions. If you cannot find an extension you know exists in your local VS Code, please get in touch with us or open a new PR in the [open-vsx/publish-extensions](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions) repository to add the extension to Open VSX 🙏.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default   |
| -------- | --------- |
| `object` | `<empty>` |

</div>

By default, extensions will use the latest available version unless you use a specific version number. The version number must use semantic versioning rules. If you are interested in importing an extension that is not published on the Open VSX registry you can directly use the full URL.

**Example**

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - svelte.svelte-vscode
    - bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss@0.6.11
    - https://example.com/abc/releases/extension-0.26.0.vsix
```

## `workspaceLocation`

Define which path Gitpod considers the project's workspace directory, relative to `/workspace`.

In most cases, this is not needed. If you work on an older Go project, please see the [Go Languages](/docs/introduction/languages/go) page for more details.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Type     | Default      |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `string` | `/workspace` |

</div>

**Example**

```yaml
workspaceLocation: "."
```

> {title} is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

## Getting started

1. **Install [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/remote-development-a.html#gateway)** - With the [JetBrains Gateway and Gitpod](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) plugin you can create and manage your latest 20 Gitpod workspaces.
2. **Install the Gitpod plugin** - Open JetBrains Gateway and you'll see the Gitpod logo on the main page. Click "install" to install the [Gitpod plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) for JetBrains Gateway.
3. **Update your Gitpod preferences** - Select {title} on the [Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences) which will set {title} as your default IDE for future workspace starts.
4. **Start (or restart) your workspace** - Either start a workspace directly from within the [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) via the Gitpod plugin **OR** open a new workspace directly in Gitpod where on workspace start you will be prompted to open {title} for that workspace.

**Important:** You must restart any started workspaces for your IDE preferences to take effect.

## Install Plugins

> This section relates to plugin management when using JetBrains IDEs in a remote development context. For information on regular plugin management, refer to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/managing-plugins.html" target="_blank">{title} docs</a>.

Unlike with regular development, JetBrains [Remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/remote-development-overview.html#defs) with {title} allows users to install plugins in different locations:

- [**{title} backend plugins**](#install-on-title-backend) - The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality for IDE experiences relating to the filesystem, tools or languages and frameworks. When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start. It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.
- [**JetBrains Client plugins**](#install-on-jetbrains-client) - The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins are different to backend plugins as they contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes). Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).
- [**JetBrains Gateway plugins**](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway#getting-started) - The JetBrains Gateway is an application downloaded onto a users local machine which allows users to start JetBrains Clients that are compatible with the {title} backend, running in a Gitpod workspace. JetBrains Gateway plugins are installed directly in JetBrains Gateway and contribute to remote development connection experiences (e.g. the [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) plugin).

### Install on JetBrains Client

The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes).

Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).

To install a plugin on **JetBrains Client** follow these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on JetBrains Client" src="/images/editors/install-local-jb-plugin.png">
    <figcaption>Install a plugin on JetBrains Client</figcaption>
</figure>

### Install on {title} backend

The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality requiring access to IDE experiences such as the remote filesystem (e.g. contributing support of languages and frameworks).

When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start.

It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.

#### Install for your current workspace

You can install a plugin only for **your current workspace** following these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins On Host**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on {title} backend" src="/images/editors/install-remote-jb-plugin.png">
    <figcaption>Install a plugin on {title} backend</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Preconfigure for repository

> JetBrains plugin support is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

You can share a plugin on **{title} backend** with everybody working on the repository by adding it to [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and pushing to your Git repository.
Each workspace is preconfigured with plugins from the `gitpod.yml` configuration file. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  clion:
    plugins:
      - zielu.gittoolbox
      - izhangzhihao.rainbow.brackets
```

You can find the **pluginId** on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) page:

- Find a page of the required plugin.
- Select the **Versions** tab.
- Click any version to copy the **pluginId** (short name such as `org.rust.lang`) of the plugin you want to install.

#### Install for your user

It is not yet possible to install plugins on **{title} backend** for your user to share across all your Gitpod workspaces.

## Configure JVM options

> Configuration of JVM options is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8704).

You can adjust JVM options for {title} backend, especially if you want to increase the `-Xmx` memory size. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  clion:
    vmoptions: "-Xmx4g"
```

For more detailed information on JVM options, refer to [Common JVM Options](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/tuning-the-ide.html#common-jvm-options) from JetBrains documentation.

## Configure IDE settings

> **Feedback needed:** The JetBrains Gitpod integration is currently beta. Gitpod [continues to collaborate with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains). The below shows how you can configure global settings with JetBrains. To leave feedback on the approach, please see this GitHub issue: [#6576](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576). Also note that JetBrains is working on [comprehensive settings sync functionality](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RDCT-1/Settings-synchronization).

When running {title} locally, the JetBrains IDE applies [global settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/configuring-project-and-ide-settings.html) to all projects on your machine. However when running in a remote context using [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), it's important to note that some IDE settings are configured on the [JetBrains Client](#on-jetbrains-client) and others in the [{title} backend](#on-title-backend) running in your Gitpod [Workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces). See below instructions for more.

### On JetBrains Client

IDE Settings that are configured on the JetBrains Client are stored on your local machine and don't have `On Host` label in the IDE settings. These IDE settings are reused if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the settings were initially configured.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-client-configure-settings-client.webp">
    <figcaption>JetBrains client settings don't have <code>On Host</code> label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### On {title} backend

Settings configured on {title} backend are stored in a Gitpod workspace and have `On Host` label in the IDE settings.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-backend-configure-settings.webp">
    <figcaption>{title} backend settings have `On Host` label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Configure IDE settings per project

Some IDE settings cannot be configured via [environment variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#environment-variables) or through setting [vm options](#configure-jvm-options). These settings can only be set via the UI of JetBrains client, and must be manually copied to be syned between workspaces. The below steps detail how to configure your IDE settings for all the users of a given Gitpod project:

**Step 1: Manually use JetBrains UI to configure settings** - Set your IDE settings as you normally would, using the JetBrains UI.

**Step 2: Find generated IDE settings** - You will need to manually find any global settings generated by JetBrains backend within the following path: `/workspace/.config/JetBrains<-latest>/RemoteDev-/<your-project-name>/options`

**Step 3:** Move any relevant settings manually to a persistent location within your Gitpod project. Either via a [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), or persisted in the version control of your project, for example by committing settings data to GitHub.

**Include relevant IDE settings in your Workspace Image**

- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/clion/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

**Commit relevant IDE settings to source control**

- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/clion/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

For any further changes to your IDE settings, you will need to follow the above steps again.

> **Note:** When locating and applying IDE settings, Gitpod will read the locations specified above in priority order. The locations specified first are overriden by the locations specified later.

### Configure IDE settings per user

To configure IDE settings for your user only, and not all those using a project.

Follow the instructions for [configuring IDE settings per project](#configure-ide-settings-per-project), but instead use [.dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles#dotfiles) rather than a workspace image or source control to store your IDE settings.

## Indexing using Prebuilds

> JetBrains Prebuilds is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

When you open the project {title} starts indexing to load modules and
enable the core functionality like code completion and navigation.
Depending on the size of your project indexing speed can vary significantly.

You can speed up the indexing of a project by applying these [general recommendations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/performance-tuning-tips.html).
Gitpod prebuilds allow you to improve it further by indexing before you start a new workspace.

To leverage it:

- configure prebuilds for your repository, refer to [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds);
- enable indexing for {title} in prebuilds by editing [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) in your repository:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  clion:
    prebuilds:
      version: stable
```

- push changes to your Git repository to apply.

The `version` property allows you to control whether to index for `stable`, `latest`, or `both` versions of {title} compatible with Gitpod.
Users can switch between `stable` and `latest` versions of {title} on the [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) page.

## Workspace performance

When using a Gitpod workspace you might experience performance issues caused by:

- An application using more resources than expected
- Resource consumption in adjacent containers running on the workspace node.

In your JetBrains IDE within the JetBrains Gateway [Backend Control Center](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-inside-remote-project.html#control_center) you can find two metrics relating to your running workspace: `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory`.

The remaining metrics you can find in the Backend Control Center regarding the node that your workspace is running on, and not the workspace itself.

> **Note:** Performance information shown in the Backend Control Center is the same as the information that is shown when running the command [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top) in your workspace, see the [Command Line Interface](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) documentation for more.

![jetbrains performance](/images/jetbrains-gateway/jetbrains-performance-center.png)

## FAQs

- For the questions about supported IDEs and Editors in Gitpod, refer to [FAQs](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/faqs).

- For the general questions about JetBrains Remote Development, refer to refer to the general IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/faq-about-remote-development.html" target="_blank">{title} FAQ</a>.

### Are there any JetBrains optimizations I can make if my workspace is slow?

Debugging performance can be challenging, as performance issues can depend on many factors such as how Gitpod is configured (if you're operating Gitpod on Self-Hosted). However, there are some ways you can gather performance information and optimise your JetBrains IDE setup with Gitpod:

1. Firstly, to gather information on performance, you can [view workspace performance metrics from within the IDE](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij#workspace-performance) in the Backend Control Center, or by using [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top).
2. You may also want to try adjusting the Max Heap Size allocated to the JetBrains Backend in the Settings tab of the Backend Control Center. If updating this setting helps your performance, you can set the `vmoptions` value for your JetBrains IDE in your `.gitpod.yml`.

> **Note:** If the performance metrics show that your workspace is hitting its resource limits, and you are using Gitpod Self-Hosted, it might make sense to consider changing the resource configuration for your workspaces. This can be done via a [config-patch](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches). Configuring workspace resources is not yet available on SaaS.

# Command Line (SSH)

You can directly access your workspace via SSH for editing code directly using a [command-line editor](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line), such as Vim & Emacs or for connecting SSH supported applications such as a database client.

## Workspace SSH approaches

There are two ways to access a workspace via SSH using an SSH key or an Access Token.

![Copy SSH key from modal](/images/docs/ssh-key-modal-dark-light-theme.png)
![Copy SSH key from modal](/images/docs/ssh-key-modal-dark-theme.png)

1. **SSH Key** (recommended) - By creating your own public/private SSH key pair, and uploading the public key to Gitpod you can directly SSH into a Gitpod workspace. Uploading a public key means that you do not need to keep re-visiting the Gitpod dashboard to retrieve an SSH command. It is also a more secure approach. See [configure SSH](/docs/configure/user-settings/ssh) for more.

2. **Access Token** - Alternatively, you can access a workspace using the copy/paste SSH command. This approach uses an access token which is reset on every workspace start. This approach is useful for quick SSH access, or when installing an SSH key locally is not possible, such as on some devices.

## SSH key Access

> **Note:** You must upload a public key to Gitpod before you can access your workspace using an SSH key. See [configure SSH](/docs/configure/user-settings/ssh) for more.

To access a workspace using an SSH Key:

1. Visit [your workspace list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) in Gitpod
2. View a running Gitpod workspace and click the more actions menu
3. Select "connect via SSH"
4. Copy paste the selected command

<br/>

![SSH Key access via modal](/images/docs/ssh-key-modal-dark-light-theme.png)
![SSH Key access via modal](/images/docs/ssh-key-modal-dark-theme.png)

You can also access the SSH connection string from the workspace start page, which is shown to users who have selected a desktop IDE or editor as their [preference](https://gitpod.io/preferences).

![SSH to a workspace via the workspace splash page](/images/docs/ssh-connect-splash-dark-theme.png)

## Access Token SSH

You can currently copy/paste a simple SSH command to get command line access to your workspace from the Gitpod dashboard.

1. Visit [your workspace list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) in Gitpod
2. View a running Gitpod workspace and click the more actions menu
3. Select "connect via SSH"
4. Navigate to the "Access Token" tab
5. Copy paste the selected command

## Is there a limit of IDE/editor connections to Gitpod?

There is no hard-limit about how many IDE/editors can be connected to a running Gitpod workspace. All connected IDEs/editors will have access to the same underlying file system and directories.

## What version of VS Code runs in Gitpod (in the browser)?

VS Code in the browser in Gitpod uses a fork of [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) called [openvscode-server](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server). Gitpod actively monitors VS Code's release cycle, and releases the latest version of VS Code shortly after the upstream repository is updated. You can find more information about which version of VS Code is running in the browser by navigating to "Help > About" from a running Gitpod workspace.

## Does Gitpod VS Code settings sync work with other products (e.g. Codespaces)?

Gitpod doesn't currently support settings sync with other hosted VS Code environments, such as [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/).

## My VS Code extensions are not syncing, what should I do?

1. When installing an extension in Gitpod using the `Install (Do Not Sync)` option.
2. Extensions defined in [`gitpod.yml`](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml/)
3. Extensions manually installed from a `vsix` file

## Can I use both a desktop IDE and a browser editor in Gitpod?

Yes, you can. Both desktop and browser IDEs/editors have full access to files and directories within the workspace. So, when you connect to your Gitpod workspace from your Desktop you can also access your workspace via your browser. This means browser-based editing can either be used as your first-choice editor, or as a "fall back" alternative option for when you want to make edits on the move. With Gitpod, where and how you edit your code is very flexible.

## What is the preferred IDE/editor for Gitpod?

There are many supported ways to edit your code in Gitpod, there is no preferred experience. Gitpod is intended to be flexible to allow you and your team to use the tools you are most familiar and comfortable with. You can edit code in Gitpod using:

1. [JetBrains IDE's](/docs/references/ides-and-editors) via [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway)
2. [VS Code in the browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser) and [VS Code on desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode)
3. [Command-line](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line) based editors such as Vim

Please see the [IDEs & editors](/docs/references/ides-and-editors) documentation for more details.

## Do I need a license to use JetBrains and Gitpod?

The licensing of Remote Development is handled on the local machine and is covered by your existing active IDE license. See [JetBrains documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-starting-page.html#licensing) for more.

## Will Gitpod support all the JetBrains IDE's?

Yes, the plan is to eventually support all of the JetBrains IDE's. Please refer to the [Gitpod roadmap](https://www.gitpod.io/roadmap) for future updates.

## Does Gitpod support the IntelliJ IDEA Community edition?

No, JetBrains Remote Development and Gateway are available only in the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate edition, please refer to [IntelliJ IDEA FAQ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/faq-about-remote-development.html#community).

## Will Gitpod support JetBrains Fleet?

[JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/) is a next-generation IDE from JetBrains. The currently supported method of using JetBrains IDE's with Gitpod is on desktop via [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), please refer to our documentation for current [IDE and editor support](/docs/references/ides-and-editors) and the [Gitpod roadmap](https://www.gitpod.io/roadmap) for future updates.

## Can I use JetBrains Projector with Gitpod?

Gitpod does not officially support [JetBrains Projector](https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/). Gitpod has support for [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), which is the primary tool for remote development when using JetBrains IDE's.

## Install Plugins

> This section relates to plugin management when using JetBrains IDEs in a remote development context. For information on regular plugin management, refer to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/managing-plugins.html" target="_blank">{title} docs</a>.

Unlike with regular development, JetBrains [Remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/remote-development-overview.html#defs) with {title} allows users to install plugins in different locations:

- [**{title} backend plugins**](#install-on-title-backend) - The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality for IDE experiences relating to the filesystem, tools or languages and frameworks. When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start. It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.
- [**JetBrains Client plugins**](#install-on-jetbrains-client) - The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins are different to backend plugins as they contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes). Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).
- [**JetBrains Gateway plugins**](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway#getting-started) - The JetBrains Gateway is an application downloaded onto a users local machine which allows users to start JetBrains Clients that are compatible with the {title} backend, running in a Gitpod workspace. JetBrains Gateway plugins are installed directly in JetBrains Gateway and contribute to remote development connection experiences (e.g. the [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) plugin).

### Install on JetBrains Client

The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes).

Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).

To install a plugin on **JetBrains Client** follow these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on JetBrains Client" src="/images/editors/install-local-jb-plugin.png">
    <figcaption>Install a plugin on JetBrains Client</figcaption>
</figure>

### Install on {title} backend

The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality requiring access to IDE experiences such as the remote filesystem (e.g. contributing support of languages and frameworks).

When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start.

It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.

#### Install for your current workspace

You can install a plugin only for **your current workspace** following these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins On Host**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on {title} backend" src="/images/editors/install-remote-jb-plugin.png">
    <figcaption>Install a plugin on {title} backend</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Preconfigure for repository

> JetBrains plugin support is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

You can share a plugin on **{title} backend** with everybody working on the repository by adding it to [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and pushing to your Git repository.
Each workspace is preconfigured with plugins from the `gitpod.yml` configuration file. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  goland:
    plugins:
      - zielu.gittoolbox
      - izhangzhihao.rainbow.brackets
```

You can find the **pluginId** on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) page:

- Find a page of the required plugin.
- Select the **Versions** tab.
- Click any version to copy the **pluginId** (short name such as `org.rust.lang`) of the plugin you want to install.

#### Install for your user

It is not yet possible to install plugins on **{title} backend** for your user to share across all your Gitpod workspaces.

## Configure JVM options

> Configuration of JVM options is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8704).

You can adjust JVM options for {title} backend, especially if you want to increase the `-Xmx` memory size. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  goland:
    vmoptions: "-Xmx4g"
```

For more detailed information on JVM options, refer to [Common JVM Options](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/tuning-the-ide.html#common-jvm-options) from JetBrains documentation.

## Configure IDE settings

> **Feedback needed:** The JetBrains Gitpod integration is currently beta. Gitpod [continues to collaborate with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains). The below shows how you can configure global settings with JetBrains. To leave feedback on the approach, please see this GitHub issue: [#6576](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576). Also note that JetBrains is working on [comprehensive settings sync functionality](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RDCT-1/Settings-synchronization).

When running {title} locally, the JetBrains IDE applies [global settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/configuring-project-and-ide-settings.html) to all projects on your machine. However when running in a remote context using [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), it's important to note that some IDE settings are configured on the [JetBrains Client](#on-jetbrains-client) and others in the [{title} backend](#on-title-backend) running in your Gitpod [Workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces). See below instructions for more.

### On JetBrains Client

IDE Settings that are configured on the JetBrains Client are stored on your local machine and don't have `On Host` label in the IDE settings. These IDE settings are reused if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the settings were initially configured.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-client-configure-settings-client.webp">
    <figcaption>JetBrains client settings don't have <code>On Host</code> label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### On {title} backend

Settings configured on {title} backend are stored in a Gitpod workspace and have `On Host` label in the IDE settings.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-backend-configure-settings.webp">
    <figcaption>{title} backend settings have `On Host` label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Configure IDE settings per project

Some IDE settings cannot be configured via [environment variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#environment-variables) or through setting [vm options](#configure-jvm-options). These settings can only be set via the UI of JetBrains client, and must be manually copied to be syned between workspaces. The below steps detail how to configure your IDE settings for all the users of a given Gitpod project:

**Step 1: Manually use JetBrains UI to configure settings** - Set your IDE settings as you normally would, using the JetBrains UI.

**Step 2: Find generated IDE settings** - You will need to manually find any global settings generated by JetBrains backend within the following path: `/workspace/.config/JetBrains<-latest>/RemoteDev-GO/<your-project-name>/options`

**Step 3:** Move any relevant settings manually to a persistent location within your Gitpod project. Either via a [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), or persisted in the version control of your project, for example by committing settings data to GitHub.

**Include relevant IDE settings in your Workspace Image**

- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/goland/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

**Commit relevant IDE settings to source control**

- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/goland/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

For any further changes to your IDE settings, you will need to follow the above steps again.

> **Note:** When locating and applying IDE settings, Gitpod will read the locations specified above in priority order. The locations specified first are overriden by the locations specified later.

### Configure IDE settings per user

To configure IDE settings for your user only, and not all those using a project.

Follow the instructions for [configuring IDE settings per project](#configure-ide-settings-per-project), but instead use [.dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles#dotfiles) rather than a workspace image or source control to store your IDE settings.

## Indexing using Prebuilds

> JetBrains Prebuilds is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

When you open the project {title} starts indexing to load modules and
enable the core functionality like code completion and navigation.
Depending on the size of your project indexing speed can vary significantly.

You can speed up the indexing of a project by applying these [general recommendations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/indexing.html).
Gitpod prebuilds allow you to improve it further by indexing before you start a new workspace.

To leverage it:

- configure prebuilds for your repository, refer to [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds);
- enable indexing for {title} in prebuilds by editing [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) in your repository:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  goland:
    prebuilds:
      version: stable
```

- push changes to your Git repository to apply.

The `version` property allows you to control whether to index for `stable`, `latest`, or `both` versions of {title} compatible with Gitpod.
Users can switch between `stable` and `latest` versions of {title} on the [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) page.

## Workspace performance

When using a Gitpod workspace you might experience performance issues caused by:

- An application using more resources than expected
- Resource consumption in adjacent containers running on the workspace node.

In your JetBrains IDE within the JetBrains Gateway [Backend Control Center](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-inside-remote-project.html#control_center) you can find two metrics relating to your running workspace: `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory`.

The remaining metrics you can find in the Backend Control Center regarding the node that your workspace is running on, and not the workspace itself.

> **Note:** Performance information shown in the Backend Control Center is the same as the information that is shown when running the command [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top) in your workspace, see the [Command Line Interface](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) documentation for more.

## FAQs

- For the questions about supported IDEs and Editors in Gitpod, refer to [FAQs](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/faqs).

- For the general questions about JetBrains Remote Development, refer to refer to the general IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/faq-about-remote-development.html" target="_blank">{title} FAQ</a>.

### Are there any JetBrains optimizations I can make if my workspace is slow?

Debugging performance can be challenging, as performance issues can depend on many factors such as how Gitpod is configured (if you're operating Gitpod on Self-Hosted). However, there are some ways you can gather performance information and optimise your JetBrains IDE setup with Gitpod:

1. Firstly, to gather information on performance, you can [view workspace performance metrics from within the IDE](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij#workspace-performance) in the Backend Control Center, or by using [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top).
2. You may also want to try adjusting the Max Heap Size allocated to the JetBrains Backend in the Settings tab of the Backend Control Center. If updating this setting helps your performance, you can set the `vmoptions` value for your JetBrains IDE in your `.gitpod.yml`.

> **Note:** If the performance metrics show that your workspace is hitting its resource limits, and you are using Gitpod Self-Hosted, it might make sense to consider changing the resource configuration for your workspaces. This can be done via a [config-patch](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches). Configuring workspace resources is not yet available on SaaS.

# IDEs & Editors

In line with [our ambition to "remove all friction from the developer experience"](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/Values-Attributes-2ed4c2f93c84499b98e3b5389980992e), Gitpod currently supports many popular IDE/editors e.g. JetBrains and VS Code through both the browser and on desktop. You can even use the command-line directly for editors like Vim (via SSH). There are many ways to configure your IDE/editor in Gitpod to match your preferred workflow or setup.

## Connecting an IDE/editor to Gitpod

The three main ways to edit code or access a Gitpod workspace:

1. **Browser** - Using [VS Code Browser](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser).
2. **SSH** - Using an [SSH key](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line#ssh-key-access) or an [Access Token](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line#access-token-ssh).
3. **Desktop** - Using [VS Code Desktop](ides-and-editors/vscode) or [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway).

### Supported IDE/editors

- [VS Code Browser](ides-and-editors/vscode-browser)
- [VS Code Desktop](ides-and-editors/vscode)
- [IntelliJ](ides-and-editors/intellij)
- [GoLand](ides-and-editors/goland)
- [PhpStorm](ides-and-editors/phpstorm)
- [PyCharm](ides-and-editors/pycharm)
- [RubyMine](ides-and-editors/rubymine)
- [WebStorm](ides-and-editors/webstorm)
- [Rider](ides-and-editors/rider)
- [CLion](ides-and-editors/clion)
- [Command Line (e.g. Vim)](ides-and-editors/command-line)

### Start a workspace with an IDE/editor

You can start a workspace with your favourite IDE/editor directly from [Gitpod Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). You can do that from by clicking on the `New Workspace` button. Then, you can select the [context url](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url), Editor and custom [workspace class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes).

When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start.

It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.

#### Install for your current workspace

You can install a plugin only for **your current workspace** following these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins On Host**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

</figure>

#### Preconfigure for repository

> JetBrains plugin support is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

You can share a plugin on **{title} backend** with everybody working on the repository by adding it to [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and pushing to your Git repository.
Each workspace is preconfigured with plugins from the `gitpod.yml` configuration file. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  intellij:
    plugins:
      - zielu.gittoolbox
      - izhangzhihao.rainbow.brackets
```

You can find the **pluginId** on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) page:

- Find a page of the required plugin.
- Select the **Versions** tab.
- Click any version to copy the **pluginId** (short name such as `org.rust.lang`) of the plugin you want to install.

#### Install for your user

It is not yet possible to install plugins on **{title} backend** for your user to share across all your Gitpod workspaces.

## Configure JVM options

> Configuration of JVM options is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8704).

You can adjust JVM options for {title} backend, especially if you want to increase the `-Xmx` memory size. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  intellij:
    vmoptions: "-Xmx4g"
```

For more detailed information on JVM options, refer to [Common JVM Options](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tuning-the-ide.html#common-jvm-options) from JetBrains documentation.

## Configure IDE settings

> **Feedback needed:** The JetBrains Gitpod integration is currently beta. Gitpod [continues to collaborate with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains). The below shows how you can configure global settings with JetBrains. To leave feedback on the approach, please see this GitHub issue: [#6576](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576). Also note that JetBrains is working on [comprehensive settings sync functionality](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RDCT-1/Settings-synchronization).

When running {title} locally, the JetBrains IDE applies [global settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-project-and-ide-settings.html) to all projects on your machine. However when running in a remote context using [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), it's important to note that some IDE settings are configured on the [JetBrains Client](#on-jetbrains-client) and others in the [{title} backend](#on-title-backend) running in your Gitpod [Workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces). See below instructions for more.

### On JetBrains Client

IDE Settings that are configured on the JetBrains Client are stored on your local machine and don't have `On Host` label in the IDE settings. These IDE settings are reused if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the settings were initially configured.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-client-configure-settings-client.webp">
    <figcaption>JetBrains client settings don't have <code>On Host</code> label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### On {title} backend

Settings configured on {title} backend are stored in a Gitpod workspace and have `On Host` label in the IDE settings.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-backend-configure-settings.webp">
    <figcaption>{title} backend settings have `On Host` label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Configure IDE settings per project

Some IDE settings cannot be configured via [environment variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#environment-variables) or through setting [vm options](#configure-jvm-options). These settings can only be set via the UI of JetBrains client, and must be manually copied to be syned between workspaces. The below steps detail how to configure your IDE settings for all the users of a given Gitpod project:

**Step 1: Manually use JetBrains UI to configure settings** - Set your IDE settings as you normally would, using the JetBrains UI.

**Step 2: Find generated IDE settings** - You will need to manually find any global settings generated by JetBrains backend within the following path: `/workspace/.config/JetBrains<-latest>/RemoteDev-IU/<your-project-name>/options`

**Step 3:** Move any relevant settings manually to a persistent location within your Gitpod project. Either via a [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), or persisted in the version control of your project, for example by committing settings data to GitHub.

**Include relevant IDE settings in your Workspace Image**

- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/intellij/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

**Commit relevant IDE settings to source control**

- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/intellij/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

For any further changes to your IDE settings, you will need to follow the above steps again.

> **Note:** When locating and applying IDE settings, Gitpod will read the locations specified above in priority order. The locations specified first are overriden by the locations specified later.

### Configure IDE settings per user

To configure IDE settings for your user only, and not all those using a project.

Follow the instructions for [configuring IDE settings per project](#configure-ide-settings-per-project), but instead use [.dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles#dotfiles) rather than a workspace image or source control to store your IDE settings.

## Indexing using Prebuilds

> JetBrains Prebuilds is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

When you open the project {title} starts indexing to load modules and
enable the core functionality like code completion and navigation.
Depending on the size of your project indexing speed can vary significantly.

You can speed up the indexing of a project by applying these [general recommendations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/indexing.html).
Gitpod prebuilds allow you to improve it further by indexing before you start a new workspace.

To leverage it:

- configure prebuilds for your repository, refer to [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds);
- enable indexing for {title} in prebuilds by editing [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) in your repository:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  intellij:
    prebuilds:
      version: stable
```

- push changes to your Git repository to apply.

The `version` property allows you to control whether to index for `stable`, `latest`, or `both` versions of {title} compatible with Gitpod.
Users can switch between `stable` and `latest` versions of {title} on the [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) page.

## Workspace performance

When using a Gitpod workspace you might experience performance issues caused by:

- An application using more resources than expected
- Resource consumption in adjacent containers running on the workspace node.

In your JetBrains IDE within the JetBrains Gateway [Backend Control Center](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-inside-remote-project.html#control_center) you can find two metrics relating to your running workspace: `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory`.

The remaining metrics you can find in the Backend Control Center regarding the node that your workspace is running on, and not the workspace itself.

> **Note:** Performance information shown in the Backend Control Center is the same as the information that is shown when running the command [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top) in your workspace, see the [Command Line Interface](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) documentation for more.

![jetbrains performance](/images/jetbrains-gateway/jetbrains-performance-center.png)

## FAQs

- For the questions about supported IDEs and Editors in Gitpod, refer to [FAQs](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/faqs).

- For the general questions about JetBrains Remote Development, refer to refer to the general IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/faq-about-remote-development.html" target="_blank">{title} FAQ</a>.

### Are there any JetBrains optimizations I can make if my workspace is slow?

Debugging performance can be challenging, as performance issues can depend on many factors such as how Gitpod is configured (if you're operating Gitpod on Self-Hosted). However, there are some ways you can gather performance information and optimise your JetBrains IDE setup with Gitpod:

1. Firstly, to gather information on performance, you can [view workspace performance metrics from within the IDE](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij#workspace-performance) in the Backend Control Center, or by using [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top).
2. You may also want to try adjusting the Max Heap Size allocated to the JetBrains Backend in the Settings tab of the Backend Control Center. If updating this setting helps your performance, you can set the `vmoptions` value for your JetBrains IDE in your `.gitpod.yml`.

> **Note:** If the performance metrics show that your workspace is hitting its resource limits, and you are using Gitpod Self-Hosted, it might make sense to consider changing the resource configuration for your workspaces. This can be done via a [config-patch](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches). Configuring workspace resources is not yet available on SaaS.

## Install Plugins

> This section relates to plugin management when using JetBrains IDEs in a remote development context. For information on regular plugin management, refer to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/managing-plugins.html" target="_blank">{title} docs</a>.

Unlike with regular development, JetBrains [Remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/remote-development-overview.html#defs) with {title} allows users to install plugins in different locations:

- [**{title} backend plugins**](#install-on-title-backend) - The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality for IDE experiences relating to the filesystem, tools or languages and frameworks. When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start. It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.
- [**JetBrains Client plugins**](#install-on-jetbrains-client) - The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins are different to backend plugins as they contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes). Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).
- [**JetBrains Gateway plugins**](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway#getting-started) - The JetBrains Gateway is an application downloaded onto a users local machine which allows users to start JetBrains Clients that are compatible with the {title} backend, running in a Gitpod workspace. JetBrains Gateway plugins are installed directly in JetBrains Gateway and contribute to remote development connection experiences (e.g. the [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) plugin).

### Install on JetBrains Client

The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes).

Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).

To install a plugin on **JetBrains Client** follow these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

#### Preconfigure for repository

> JetBrains plugin support is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

You can share a plugin on **{title} backend** with everybody working on the repository by adding it to [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and pushing to your Git repository.
Each workspace is preconfigured with plugins from the `gitpod.yml` configuration file. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  phpstorm:
    plugins:
      - zielu.gittoolbox
      - izhangzhihao.rainbow.brackets
```

You can find the **pluginId** on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) page:

- Find a page of the required plugin.
- Select the **Versions** tab.
- Click any version to copy the **pluginId** (short name such as `org.rust.lang`) of the plugin you want to install.

#### Install for your user

It is not yet possible to install plugins on **{title} backend** for your user to share across all your Gitpod workspaces.

## Configure JVM options

## Install Plugins

> This section relates to plugin management when using JetBrains IDEs in a remote development context. For information on regular plugin management, refer to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/managing-plugins.html" target="_blank">{title} docs</a>.

Unlike with regular development, JetBrains [Remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-development-overview.html#defs) with {title} allows users to install plugins in different locations:

- [**{title} backend plugins**](#install-on-title-backend) - The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality for IDE experiences relating to the filesystem, tools or languages and frameworks. When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start. It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.
- [**JetBrains Client plugins**](#install-on-jetbrains-client) - The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins are different to backend plugins as they contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes). Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).
- [**JetBrains Gateway plugins**](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway#getting-started) - The JetBrains Gateway is an application downloaded onto a users local machine which allows users to start JetBrains Clients that are compatible with the {title} backend, running in a Gitpod workspace. JetBrains Gateway plugins are installed directly in JetBrains Gateway and contribute to remote development connection experiences (e.g. the [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) plugin).

### Install on JetBrains Client

The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes).

Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).

To install a plugin on **JetBrains Client** follow these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

    <figcaption>Install a plugin on JetBrains Client</figcaption>
</figure>

### Install on {title} backend

The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality requiring access to IDE experiences such as the remote filesystem (e.g. contributing support of languages and frameworks).

When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start.

It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.

#### Install for your current workspace

You can install a plugin only for **your current workspace** following these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins On Host**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on {title} backend" src="/images/editors/install-remote-jb-plugin.png">

</figure>

#### Preconfigure for repository

> JetBrains plugin support is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

You can share a plugin on **{title} backend** with everybody working on the repository by adding it to [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and pushing to your Git repository.
Each workspace is preconfigured with plugins from the `gitpod.yml` configuration file. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  pycharm:
    plugins:
      - zielu.gittoolbox
      - izhangzhihao.rainbow.brackets
```

You can find the **pluginId** on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) page:

- Find a page of the required plugin.
- Select the **Versions** tab.
- Click any version to copy the **pluginId** (short name such as `org.rust.lang`) of the plugin you want to install.

#### Install for your user

It is not yet possible to install plugins on **{title} backend** for your user to share across all your Gitpod workspaces.

## Configure JVM options

> Configuration of JVM options is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8704).

You can adjust JVM options for {title} backend, especially if you want to increase the `-Xmx` memory size. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  pycharm:
    vmoptions: "-Xmx4g"
```

For more detailed information on JVM options, refer to [Common JVM Options](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/tuning-the-ide.html#common-jvm-options) from JetBrains documentation.

## Configure IDE settings

> **Feedback needed:** The JetBrains Gitpod integration is currently beta. Gitpod [continues to collaborate with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains). The below shows how you can configure global settings with JetBrains. To leave feedback on the approach, please see this GitHub issue: [#6576](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576). Also note that JetBrains is working on [comprehensive settings sync functionality](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RDCT-1/Settings-synchronization).

When running {title} locally, the JetBrains IDE applies [global settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-project-and-ide-settings.html) to all projects on your machine. However when running in a remote context using [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), it's important to note that some IDE settings are configured on the [JetBrains Client](#on-jetbrains-client) and others in the [{title} backend](#on-title-backend) running in your Gitpod [Workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces). See below instructions for more.

### On JetBrains Client

IDE Settings that are configured on the JetBrains Client are stored on your local machine and don't have `On Host` label in the IDE settings. These IDE settings are reused if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the settings were initially configured.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-client-configure-settings-client.webp">
    <figcaption>JetBrains client settings don't have <code>On Host</code> label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### On {title} backend

Settings configured on {title} backend are stored in a Gitpod workspace and have `On Host` label in the IDE settings.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-backend-configure-settings.webp">
    <figcaption>{title} backend settings have `On Host` label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Configure IDE settings per project

Some IDE settings cannot be configured via [environment variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#environment-variables) or through setting [vm options](#configure-jvm-options). These settings can only be set via the UI of JetBrains client, and must be manually copied to be syned between workspaces. The below steps detail how to configure your IDE settings for all the users of a given Gitpod project:

**Step 1: Manually use JetBrains UI to configure settings** - Set your IDE settings as you normally would, using the JetBrains UI.

**Step 2: Find generated IDE settings** - You will need to manually find any global settings generated by JetBrains backend within the following path: `/workspace/.config/JetBrains<-latest>/RemoteDev-PY/<your-project-name>/options`

**Step 3:** Move any relevant settings manually to a persistent location within your Gitpod project. Either via a [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), or persisted in the version control of your project, for example by committing settings data to GitHub.

**Include relevant IDE settings in your Workspace Image**

- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/pycharm/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

**Commit relevant IDE settings to source control**

- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/pycharm/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

For any further changes to your IDE settings, you will need to follow the above steps again.

> **Note:** When locating and applying IDE settings, Gitpod will read the locations specified above in priority order. The locations specified first are overriden by the locations specified later.

### Configure IDE settings per user

To configure IDE settings for your user only, and not all those using a project.

Follow the instructions for [configuring IDE settings per project](#configure-ide-settings-per-project), but instead use [.dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles#dotfiles) rather than a workspace image or source control to store your IDE settings.

## Indexing using Prebuilds

> JetBrains Prebuilds is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

When you open the project {title} starts indexing to load modules and
enable the core functionality like code completion and navigation.
Depending on the size of your project indexing speed can vary significantly.

You can speed up the indexing of a project by applying these [general recommendations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/indexing.html).
Gitpod prebuilds allow you to improve it further by indexing before you start a new workspace.

To leverage it:

- configure prebuilds for your repository, refer to [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds);
- enable indexing for {title} in prebuilds by editing [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) in your repository:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  pycharm:
    prebuilds:
      version: stable
```

- push changes to your Git repository to apply.

The `version` property allows you to control whether to index for `stable`, `latest`, or `both` versions of {title} compatible with Gitpod.
Users can switch between `stable` and `latest` versions of {title} on the [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) page.

## Workspace performance

When using a Gitpod workspace you might experience performance issues caused by:

- An application using more resources than expected
- Resource consumption in adjacent containers running on the workspace node.

In your JetBrains IDE within the JetBrains Gateway [Backend Control Center](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-inside-remote-project.html#control_center) you can find two metrics relating to your running workspace: `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory`.

The remaining metrics you can find in the Backend Control Center regarding the node that your workspace is running on, and not the workspace itself.

> **Note:** Performance information shown in the Backend Control Center is the same as the information that is shown when running the command [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top) in your workspace, see the [Command Line Interface](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) documentation for more.

## FAQs

- For the questions about supported IDEs and Editors in Gitpod, refer to [FAQs](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/faqs).

- For the general questions about JetBrains Remote Development, refer to refer to the general IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/faq-about-remote-development.html" target="_blank">{title} FAQ</a>.

### Are there any JetBrains optimizations I can make if my workspace is slow?

Debugging performance can be challenging, as performance issues can depend on many factors such as how Gitpod is configured (if you're operating Gitpod on Self-Hosted). However, there are some ways you can gather performance information and optimise your JetBrains IDE setup with Gitpod:

1. Firstly, to gather information on performance, you can [view workspace performance metrics from within the IDE](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij#workspace-performance) in the Backend Control Center, or by using [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top).
2. You may also want to try adjusting the Max Heap Size allocated to the JetBrains Backend in the Settings tab of the Backend Control Center. If updating this setting helps your performance, you can set the `vmoptions` value for your JetBrains IDE in your `.gitpod.yml`.

> **Note:** If the performance metrics show that your workspace is hitting its resource limits, and you are using Gitpod Self-Hosted, it might make sense to consider changing the resource configuration for your workspaces. This can be done via a [config-patch](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches). Configuring workspace resources is not yet available on SaaS.

# Rider

> {title} is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

## Getting started

1. **Install [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Remote_development-a.html#gateway#gateway)** - With the [JetBrains Gateway and Gitpod](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) plugin you can create and manage your latest 20 Gitpod workspaces.
2. **Install the Gitpod plugin** - Open JetBrains Gateway and you'll see the Gitpod logo on the main page. Click "install" to install the [Gitpod plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) for JetBrains Gateway.
3. **Update your Gitpod preferences** - Select {title} on the [Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences) which will set {title} as your default IDE for future workspace starts.
4. **Start (or restart) your workspace** - Either start a workspace directly from within the [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) via the Gitpod plugin **OR** open a new workspace directly in Gitpod where on workspace start you will be prompted to open {title} for that workspace.

**Important:** You must restart any started workspaces for your IDE preferences to take effect.

## Prerequisites

To successfully use Rider and load a .NET project, your workspace needs the .NET Framework or a compatible alternative, to be installed. The [default workspace image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#use-a-public-docker-image) does not come with .NET pre-installed, so you have two options:

**Using the .NET workspace image (Recommended)**

1. Create a `.gitpod.yml` file
2. Set the `image` property to `image: gitpod/workspace-dotnet:latest` or alternatively, [use a custom Dockerfile](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#use-a-custom-dockerfile)

If you need a specific version of .NET, check out our [Dockerfile](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/main/chunks/tool-dotnet/Dockerfile) so you can create your own, specifying the version you need.

For additional examples, check out [.NET in Gitpod](/docs/introduction/languages/dotnet).

**Manually install .NET**

1. Using a workspace terminal, install `dotnet` or a compatible alternative
2. Restart the IDE

Note: manually installed dependencies are only available in the current workspace, when you start a new workspace dotnet will not be pre-installed, for this reason we recommend the first option.

## Indexing using Prebuilds

Currently, prebuilds for Rider are not supported. To leave feedback or check for updates, see [gitpod/issues/6740](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6740).

> **Note:** Performance information shown in the Backend Control Center is the same as the information that is shown when running the command [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top) in your workspace, see the [Command Line Interface](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) documentation for more.

## FAQs

- For the questions about supported IDEs and Editors in Gitpod, refer to [FAQs](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/faqs).

- For the general questions about JetBrains Remote Development, refer to refer to the general IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/FAQ_about_remote_development.html" target="_blank">{title} FAQ</a>.

### Are there any JetBrains optimizations I can make if my workspace is slow?

Debugging performance can be challenging, as performance issues can depend on many factors such as how Gitpod is configured (if you're operating Gitpod on Self-Hosted). However, there are some ways you can gather performance information and optimise your JetBrains IDE setup with Gitpod:

1. Firstly, to gather information on performance, you can [view workspace performance metrics from within the IDE](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij#workspace-performance) in the Backend Control Center, or by using [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top).
2. You may also want to try adjusting the Max Heap Size allocated to the JetBrains Backend in the Settings tab of the Backend Control Center. If updating this setting helps your performance, you can set the `vmoptions` value for your JetBrains IDE in your `.gitpod.yml`.

> **Note:** If the performance metrics show that your workspace is hitting its resource limits, and you are using Gitpod Self-Hosted, it might make sense to consider changing the resource configuration for your workspaces. This can be done via a [config-patch](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches). Configuring workspace resources is not yet available on SaaS.

## Getting started

1. **Install [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/remote-development-a.html#gateway)** - With the [JetBrains Gateway and Gitpod](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) plugin you can create and manage your latest 20 Gitpod workspaces.
2. **Install the Gitpod plugin** - Open JetBrains Gateway and you'll see the Gitpod logo on the main page. Click "install" to install the [Gitpod plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) for JetBrains Gateway.
3. **Update your Gitpod preferences** - Select {title} on the [Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences) which will set {title} as your default IDE for future workspace starts.
4. **Start (or restart) your workspace** - Either start a workspace directly from within the [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway) via the Gitpod plugin **OR** open a new workspace directly in Gitpod where on workspace start you will be prompted to open {title} for that workspace.

**Important:** You must restart any started workspaces for your IDE preferences to take effect.

## Install Plugins

> This section relates to plugin management when using JetBrains IDEs in a remote development context. For information on regular plugin management, refer to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/managing-plugins.html" target="_blank">{title} docs</a>.

Unlike with regular development, JetBrains [Remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/remote-development-overview.html#defs) with {title} allows users to install plugins in different locations:

- [**{title} backend plugins**](#install-on-title-backend) - The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality for IDE experiences relating to the filesystem, tools or languages and frameworks. When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start. It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.
- [**JetBrains Client plugins**](#install-on-jetbrains-client) - The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins are different to backend plugins as they contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes). Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).
- [**JetBrains Gateway plugins**](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway#getting-started) - The JetBrains Gateway is an application downloaded onto a users local machine which allows users to start JetBrains Clients that are compatible with the {title} backend, running in a Gitpod workspace. JetBrains Gateway plugins are installed directly in JetBrains Gateway and contribute to remote development connection experiences (e.g. the [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) plugin).

### Install on JetBrains Client

The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes).

Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).

To install a plugin on **JetBrains Client** follow these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on JetBrains Client" src="/images/editors/install-local-jb-plugin.png">
    <figcaption>Install a plugin on JetBrains Client</figcaption>
</figure>

### Install on {title} backend

The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality requiring access to IDE experiences such as the remote filesystem (e.g. contributing support of languages and frameworks).

When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start.

It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.

#### Install for your current workspace

You can install a plugin only for **your current workspace** following these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins On Host**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on {title} backend" src="/images/editors/install-remote-jb-plugin.png">
    <figcaption>Install a plugin on {title} backend</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Preconfigure for repository

> JetBrains plugin support is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

You can share a plugin on **{title} backend** with everybody working on the repository by adding it to [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and pushing to your Git repository.
Each workspace is preconfigured with plugins from the `gitpod.yml` configuration file. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  rubymine:
    plugins:
      - zielu.gittoolbox
      - izhangzhihao.rainbow.brackets
```

You can find the **pluginId** on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) page:

- Find a page of the required plugin.
- Select the **Versions** tab.
- Click any version to copy the **pluginId** (short name such as `org.rust.lang`) of the plugin you want to install.

#### Install for your user

It is not yet possible to install plugins on **{title} backend** for your user to share across all your Gitpod workspaces.

## Configure JVM options

> Configuration of JVM options is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8704).

You can adjust JVM options for {title} backend, especially if you want to increase the `-Xmx` memory size. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  rubymine:
    vmoptions: "-Xmx4g"
```

For more detailed information on JVM options, refer to [Common JVM Options](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/tuning-the-ide.html#common-jvm-options) from JetBrains documentation.

## Configure IDE settings

> **Feedback needed:** The JetBrains Gitpod integration is currently beta. Gitpod [continues to collaborate with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains). The below shows how you can configure global settings with JetBrains. To leave feedback on the approach, please see this GitHub issue: [#6576](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576). Also note that JetBrains is working on [comprehensive settings sync functionality](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RDCT-1/Settings-synchronization).

When running {title} locally, the JetBrains IDE applies [global settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/configuring-project-and-ide-settings.html) to all projects on your machine. However when running in a remote context using [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), it's important to note that some IDE settings are configured on the [JetBrains Client](#on-jetbrains-client) and others in the [{title} backend](#on-title-backend) running in your Gitpod [Workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces). See below instructions for more.

### On JetBrains Client

IDE Settings that are configured on the JetBrains Client are stored on your local machine and don't have `On Host` label in the IDE settings. These IDE settings are reused if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the settings were initially configured.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-client-configure-settings-client.webp">
    <figcaption>JetBrains client settings don't have <code>On Host</code> label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### On {title} backend

Settings configured on {title} backend are stored in a Gitpod workspace and have `On Host` label in the IDE settings.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Configure IDE settings on JetBrains client" src="/images/editors/jb-backend-configure-settings.webp">
    <figcaption>{title} backend settings have `On Host` label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Configure IDE settings per project

Some IDE settings cannot be configured via [environment variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#environment-variables) or through setting [vm options](#configure-jvm-options). These settings can only be set via the UI of JetBrains client, and must be manually copied to be syned between workspaces. The below steps detail how to configure your IDE settings for all the users of a given Gitpod project:

**Step 1: Manually use JetBrains UI to configure settings** - Set your IDE settings as you normally would, using the JetBrains UI.

**Step 2: Find generated IDE settings** - You will need to manually find any global settings generated by JetBrains backend within the following path: `/workspace/.config/JetBrains<-latest>/RemoteDev-RM/<your-project-name>/options`

**Step 3:** Move any relevant settings manually to a persistent location within your Gitpod project. Either via a [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), or persisted in the version control of your project, for example by committing settings data to GitHub.

**Include relevant IDE settings in your Workspace Image**

- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/rubymine/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

**Commit relevant IDE settings to source control**

- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/rubymine/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

For any further changes to your IDE settings, you will need to follow the above steps again.

> **Note:** When locating and applying IDE settings, Gitpod will read the locations specified above in priority order. The locations specified first are overriden by the locations specified later.

### Configure IDE settings per user

To configure IDE settings for your user only, and not all those using a project.

Follow the instructions for [configuring IDE settings per project](#configure-ide-settings-per-project), but instead use [.dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles#dotfiles) rather than a workspace image or source control to store your IDE settings.

## Indexing using Prebuilds

> JetBrains Prebuilds is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

When you open the project {title} starts indexing to load modules and
enable the core functionality like code completion and navigation.
Depending on the size of your project indexing speed can vary significantly.

You can speed up the indexing of a project by applying these [general recommendations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/indexing.html).
Gitpod prebuilds allow you to improve it further by indexing before you start a new workspace.

To leverage it:

- configure prebuilds for your repository, refer to [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds);
- enable indexing for {title} in prebuilds by editing [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) in your repository:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  rubymine:
    prebuilds:
      version: stable
```

- push changes to your Git repository to apply.

The `version` property allows you to control whether to index for `stable`, `latest`, or `both` versions of {title} compatible with Gitpod.
Users can switch between `stable` and `latest` versions of {title} on the [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) page.

## Workspace performance

When using a Gitpod workspace you might experience performance issues caused by:

- An application using more resources than expected
- Resource consumption in adjacent containers running on the workspace node.

In your JetBrains IDE within the JetBrains Gateway [Backend Control Center](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-inside-remote-project.html#control_center) you can find two metrics relating to your running workspace: `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory`.

The remaining metrics you can find in the Backend Control Center regarding the node that your workspace is running on, and not the workspace itself.

> **Note:** Performance information shown in the Backend Control Center is the same as the information that is shown when running the command [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top) in your workspace, see the [Command Line Interface](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) documentation for more.

# VS Code settings sync

VS Code is beloved for its endless customization possibilities.

However, you may come across the challenge of having many multiple VS Code instances needing to share the same extensions, themes and settings. Since every start of a [Gitpod workspace](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/one-workspace-per-task) is a new instance of VS Code, using [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) helps you avoid re-setting your environment for each new workspace and embrace ephemeral Gitpod workspaces.

## How VS Code Setting Sync works

Once enabled, Settings Sync polls the backend to ensure that your settings are stored. To save network bandwidth and allow for more frequent synchronization only changed items are pushed to the server after the first sync.

The following settings are synced via Settings Sync:

- [VS Code preferences](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)
- [Keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)
- [Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)
- [Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks#_user-level-tasks)
- [Installed Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_manage-extensions)
- [Global State](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync#_sync-user-global-state-between-machines)

## Gitpod vs Microsoft Settings Sync

By default, most desktop VS Code installations are configured to sync settings via a GitHub or a Microsoft account. These settings are synced to Microsoft's servers and are inaccessible to third-parties, including Gitpod. Due to this limitation of access to settings stored in Microsoft servers, Gitpod implements its own VS Code settings sync server. Gitpod **Settings Sync is enabled by default for VS Code in the browser, but must be configured for desktop**.

### Enabling Settings Sync in VS Code Browser

VS Code in the browser with Gitpod has Settings Sync enabled by default, syncing preferences to Gitpod's servers.

### Enabling Settings Sync in VS Code Desktop

1. Install and enable the [Gitpod extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gitpod.gitpod-desktop).

**Note:** If you open VS Code Desktop directly from Gitpod, the Gitpod extension is automatically installed for you.

<figure>

    <figcaption>Prompt to restart VS Code Desktop</figcaption>
</figure>

> **Important:** You must entirely close VS Code Desktop for changes to take effect.

4. Enable settings sync from the Manage gear menu at the bottom of the Activity Bar.

You must authenticate with Gitpod to enable settings sync.

# VS Code Browser

VS Code Browser is the default editor that workspaces open in when using Gitpod. You can even [configure your VS Code extension](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-extensions) preferences by updating your .gitpod.yml.

![VS Code](../../../static/images/gitpod-editor.jpg)

## Changing the VS Code Browser version

VS Code Browser in Gitpod is based on a fork of [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) called [OpenVSCode Server
](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server). VS Code in the browser in Gitpod is updated frequently, to use the latest nightly build of Gitpod you can switch to the "insiders" version of VS Code from [your Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences).

## Settings Sync

By default, all your extensions and other preferences are synced between all of your workspaces on Gitpod. You can read more about over at [Settings Sync](settings-sync).

## Upload Files

You can upload files to your workspace by dragging and dropping them into the editor. You can also upload files by clicking the "Upload" button in the file explorer.

# VS Code extensions

Gitpod already comes well equipped for most development tasks, and provides language support for the most popular programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C/C++, Java, Ruby, and many more out of the box.

Still, you may wish to customize Gitpod, or to extend it with new features. You can do this by installing VS Code extensions.

`youtube: TwXYbZKEuoA`

## Installing an Extension

To install a VS Code extension in Gitpod, simply go to the left vertical menu, and open the Extensions view. There you can search for an extension and install it with one click.

For [VS Code Browser](vscode-browser), we use the [Open VSX](#open-vsx) registry. If you can't find an extension you use in your local VS Code, please read the "[Where do I find extensions?](#where-do-i-find-extensions)" section below.

If the extension is helpful to anyone who works on the project, you can add it to the `.gitpod.yml` configuration file so that it gets installed for anyone who works on the project. To do that:

1. Visit the extension page (where you installed it from)
2. Click the settings icon
3. Select "Add to .gitpod.yml" from the menu

Your project's `.gitpod.yml` is updated automatically and lists the given extension. You can also directly edit this file to install or remove extensions manually.

Here is an example of what a `.gitpod.yml` with installed extensions may look like:

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - svelte.svelte-vscode
    - bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss@0.6.11
    - https://example.com/abc/releases/extension-0.26.0.vsix
```

You can share the installed extensions with your organization by committing the `.gitpod.yml` change and pushing it to your Git repository.

Extensions are installed in the `/workspace/.vscode-remote/extensions/` directory.

## User Extensions

You have two options to install extensions for yourself only:

1. For the current workspace only - if you don't want extensions to be synced across workspaces, select `Install (Do Not Sync)` instead of `Install` when installing new extensions.
2. For all your workspaces - can be useful for extensions that you want to have in all your projects (for example a custom theme), and this doesn't require changing every project's `.gitpod.yml` configuration. **All manually installed extensions are synced across workspaces by default**.

You can read more about why and how extensions are synced on the [Settings Sync](settings-sync) page.

## Built-in Extensions

Gitpod already comes with a number of commonly used VS Code extensions pre-installed by default.

You can view all pre-installed extensions by navigating to VS Code's Extensions section on the left-hand side. In the "Search Extensions in Marketplace" input field, type `@builtin` to see the built-in extensions.

## Use of Microsoft-owned extensions in Gitpod

You can only use extensions available on the [Open VSX](#open-vsx) registry with [VS Code Browser](vscode-browser) on Gitpod. Microsoft only permits use of their marketplace via "Microsoft’s publicly supported interfaces" (see their [ToS](https://cdn.vsassets.io/v/M190_20210811.1/_content/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Marketplace-Terms-of-Use.pdf) section `1f`), and this restriction applies to the Gitpod VS Code Browser integration. If you wish to use extensions from Microsoft's VS Code Marketplace, you must use [VS Code Desktop](vscode).

The following extensions are therefore not available in VS Code Browser:

- [Microsoft Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- [Microsoft C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
- [Microsoft .Net](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime)
- [Microsoft C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

## Install VS Code extensions from a VSIX file

It is possible to develop, install and test your own custom VS Code extensions in Gitpod. While developing the extension, you can test it by uploading the `.vsix` file to your Gitpod workspace.

**Please note:**

- You can install any private extensions using manual VSIX installation.
- Installing a `.vsix` in Gitpod does not list that extension anywhere public.
- Any `.vsix` referenced in the `.gitpod.yml` must be publicly accessible.

## Open VSX

Open VSX is an open source VS Code extensions registry. For VS Code Browser in Gitpod, Gitpod uses a self-hosted mirror of the public Open VSX instance provided by the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/), [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org/). Any extensions published to Open VSX are immediately reflected in the Gitpod OpenVSX mirror.

### Why do we need Open VSX?

VS Code Browser is prohibited from accessing the Microsoft VS Code Extensions marketplace.

See [Use of Microsoft owned extensions in Gitpod](#use-of-microsoft-owned-extensions-in-gitpod) for more.

### Where do I find extensions?

If you cannot find an extension by searching in Gitpod using [VS Code Browser](vscode-browser), the extension, in many cases, was not yet added to the [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/) registry.

In that case, please reach out to the extension author and politely ask them to publish their extension to the vendor-neutral, open-source Open VSX registry. The ["how to Publish an Extension"](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Publishing-Extensions) docs provide step-by-step instructions.

> **Note**: `.vsix` files downloaded from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) should not be installed in Gitpod.

See [Use of Microsoft owned extensions in Gitpod](#use-of-microsoft-owned-extensions-in-gitpod) for more.

# VS Code Desktop

With VS Code Desktop Support, you keep your local editor configurations<sup>1</sup> and benefit from Gitpod's high-spec servers & automated prebuilds. As usual, your code executes in an ephemeral Gitpod workspace, keeping each of your projects isolated from one another.

`youtube: kI6firDA0Bw`

## Open a workspace in VS Code Desktop

There are currently three supported ways to open a VS Code Desktop session connected to a Gitpod workspace, either by opening it from the [Gitpod dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces), choosing VS Code Desktop as your default preference, or directly from within VS Code Browser itself.

### Open VS Code Desktop from the Gitpod Dashboard

You can start a workspace with VS Code Desktop directly from [Gitpod Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). You can do that from by clicking on the `New Workspace` button. Then, you can select the [context url](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url), Editor and custom [workspace class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes).

    <figcaption>Open New Gitpod Workspace with VS Code Desktop • <a href="https://gitpod.io/workspaces">Gitpod Dashboard</a></figcaption>
</figure>

### Open VS Code Desktop from VS Code Browser

1. Start a new Gitpod workspace
2. Open the command palette (<Keybind>CtrlCmd + Shift + P</Keybind>)
3. Type "Open in VS Code" and hit <Keybind>Enter</Keybind>

You will now be redirected to VS Code Desktop.

![Open VS Code via the Command Palette](/images/editors/open-in-vscode-command-palette-dark-theme.png)
_Open VS Code via the Command Palette_

### Open VS Code Desktop using your preferences

1. Navigate to your [Gitpod preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences)
2. Select "VS Code" (without the browser label)
3. Restart any running workspaces

When the workspace starts, you will be prompted to open VS Code Desktop. You can also access your workspace using VS Code Browser, or copy SSH credentials from this page.

_Selecting VS Code Desktop as an editor preference_

## Connecting to VS Code Desktop (SSH)

The three main methods granting VS Code Desktop access to your workspace are:

1. SSH Gateway access using an uploaded public SSH key (recommended)
2. SSH Gateway access using the owner token
3. Using Local Companion (legacy)

See [configure SSH](/docs/configure/user-settings/ssh) for more on SSH Gateway.

> **Important:** You must first ensure that `gitpod.remote.useLocalApp` is set to `false` in your VS Code user preferences for Gitpod to connect via the two SSH Gateway methods.

### Connect to VS Code Desktop using an uploaded public SSH key

First, VS Code Desktop will check if you have already added a public SSH key to Gitpod and that the associated private key is available on your device.

If you haven't set up an SSH key with Gitpod, you can go to [gitpod.io/keys](https://gitpod.io/keys) to upload a public key. Alternatively, you can continue using the owner token approach detailed below.

<div align="center">
  <img alt="The VS Code Desktop prompt from Gitpod when opening a workspace with no SSH key found locally or uploaded to Gitpod" src="/images/editors/no-registered-ssh-key-for-this-machine.png" width="50%">
  <p><i>The VS Code Desktop prompt from Gitpod when opening a workspace with no SSH key found locally or uploaded to Gitpod.</i></p>
  <br />
</div>

You must have at least one public key uploaded to Gitpod, and a matching private key locally on your device to avoid this prompt. VS Code Desktop will look to find private keys in the following named files within the `.ssh` directory listed under your home directory.

- `id_dsa`
- `id_dsa`
- `id_ecdsa`
- `id_rsa`
- `id_ed25519`
- `id_xmss`
- `id_ecdsa_sk`
- `id_ed25519_sk`

### Connect to VS Code Desktop using the workspace owner token

If you cannot upload a public key to Gitpod (for whatever reason) selecting **Copy** will allow you to proceed to access your Gitpod workspace using the owner token approach. Selecting **Copy** will copy the necessary password to your clipboard to be pasted in the subsequent password prompt.

![VS Code prompting for a password. This message is shown when the public key warning notice is dismissed on the previous page by selecting Copy](/images/editors/enter-password-for-ssh-connection-dark-theme.png)
![VS Code prompting for a password. This message is shown when the public key warning notice is dismissed on the previous page by selecting Copy](/images/editors/enter-password-for-ssh-connection-light-theme.png)
_VS Code prompting for a password. This message is shown when the public key warning notice is dismissed on the previous page by selecting Copy._

> **Note:** Gitpod previously required a local private SSH key to be stored in the default SSH directory, otherwise Gitpod would prompt for a "password". This limitation is no longer required. If not using an SSH uploaded key, you may be prompted for a password (the owner token), or asked for the passphrase associated with your SSH key.

### Connect to VS Code Desktop using Local Companion (Legacy)

If VS Code Desktop cannot connect directly via the SSH Gateway methods described above, the Local Companion approach is used as a fallback to tunnel your SSH connection. Gitpod via the VS Code Desktop plugin will download and start the Local Companion process on your behalf.

This approach is not recommended because:

1. It overwrites your [`remote.SSH.configFile`](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/10/03/remote-ssh-tips-and-tricks) VS Code setting.
2. Downloads and starts Local Companion in a non-transparent way.
3. Is less performant than the SSH Gateway approach.

If required, you manually can force VS Code Desktop to always fallback to the Local Companion by setting the property `gitpod.remote.useLocalApp` in your user preferences to `true`.

![The VS Code Desktop Gitpod extension useLocalApp setting](/images/editors/vscode-local-app-setting-dark-theme.png)
![The VS Code Desktop Gitpod extension useLocalApp setting](/images/editors/vscode-local-app-setting-light-theme.png)
_The VS Code Desktop Gitpod extension "useLocalApp" setting_

> **Deprecation Notice:** The fallback SSH connection using Local Companion for VS Code Desktop will be deprecated in a future release of Gitpod. If you cannot connect to your workspaces directly via SSH, for example, because your firewall is blocking the SSH connection, please [contact support](https://www.gitpod.io/support) with [troubleshooting logs](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/help/troubleshooting#gitpod-logs-in-vs-code-web-and-desktop).

## Reconnect to VS Code Desktop

When VS Code Desktop disconnects from the workspace, either you are experiencing genuine connectivity issues, or it's possible that the workspace has timed out and stopped.

![VS Code Desktop attempting to reconnect](/images/editors/reconnect-window-light-theme.png)
![VS Code Desktop attempting to reconnect](/images/editors/reconnect-window-dark-theme.png)
_VS Code Desktop attempting to reconnect_

To restart the workspace, click **Open Workspace** from the workspace start page or from the dashboard and VS Code Desktop should automatically reconnect.

**Please note:** There is currently no way to start a workspace directly from VS Code Desktop.

_The open workspace button shown on a stopped workspace page_

## VS Code settings sync

You can optionally enable Settings Sync with Gitpod to keep your extensions, themes and settings up-to-date with VS Code Browser and Desktop. See [VS Code settings sync](settings-sync) for more

![Enable Settings Sync with Gitpod](/images/editors/enable-signin-with-gitpod-light-theme.png)

## Managing VS Code extensions

VS Code runs extensions in one of two places: locally on the UI / client side, or remotely on your Gitpod workspace.

For further details, please refer to the official VS Code docs on how to [manage extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_managing-extensions).

## Custom fonts in VS Code Desktop

The process of installing fonts matches how you typically install custom fonts locally:

1. Download the desired font to your local machine and install it locally on your operating system.
1. Open the editor's user settings (e.g. _File_ > _Preferences_ > _Settings_ > _User_)
1. Configure your font with the `editor.fontFamily` setting:
   ```json
   {
     "editor.fontFamily": "Your custom font name"
   }
   ```

## Optimizing VS Code Desktop

If you're using VS Code Desktop for frequent work you'll want to optimize your setup. Below are some tips to get a workspace set up as efficient as possible.

### SSH fingerprint

![Accepting the SSH fingerprint in VS Code](/images/editors/vscode-ssh-fingerprint-light-theme.png)
![Accepting the SSH fingerprint in VS Code](/images/editors/vscode-ssh-fingerprint-dark-theme.png)
_Accepting the SSH fingerprint in VS Code_

It is common convention to be asked for a fingerprint when accessing a new SSH server. When the fingerprint is accepted, a reference to the server is stored in your local `known_hosts` file, which suppresses subsequent SSH connection prompts for that server.

You should only be presented with a request to trust the Gitpod workspace when using the legacy Local Companion approach of connecting to VS Code Desktop.

By swapping to the SSH Gateway approach of accessing VS Code Desktop, your known hosts file will be updated automatically. See [connecting to VS Code Desktop](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode#connecting-to-vs-code-desktop-ssh) for more.

### Workspace Trust

![The VS Code Workspace Trust popup](/images/editors/trust-authors-workspace-light-theme.png)
![The VS Code Workspace Trust popup](/images/editors/trust-authors-workspace-dark-theme.png)
_The VS Code Workspace Trust popup_

[Workspace Trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust#_trusting-a-workspace) is a feature within VS Code implemented to help prevent automatic code execution by disabling or limiting the operation of several VS Code features: tasks, debugging, workspace settings, and extensions.

When opening a Gitpod workspace with VS Code Desktop for the first time you will be prompted by a trust modal (given that you have not disabled the workspace trust setting in VS Code).

Selecting "**Yes, I trust the authors**" will open the workspace and store a reference to the workspace host and directory. Opening the same workspace will not show the prompt again. However, due to a hostname change, new workspaces require trust to be accepted on first open.

Choosing "**No, I do not trust the authors**" will enter you into the VS Code Restricted Mode. You can edit code in your workspace, but some features will be restricted. You can disable the VS Code Restricted Mode after the initial prompt.

If required, you can disable the workspace trust feature, however this is not recommended. Select "**Manage Workspace Trust**" from the Manage gear menu to view and modify your VS Code Workspace Trust settings.

![Updating Workspace Trust settings](/images/editors/manage-workspace-trust-dark-theme.png)

See [Workspace Trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust) in the VS Code official documentation for more.

## FAQs

### When opening VS Code Desktop, the owner token wasn't copied to my clipboard, where can I find it?

When opening VS Code Desktop, if you are being prompted for the owner token password, but cannot copy it to clipboard, you can find the password on the gitpod [workspaces page](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) under "connect via SSH".

![The password prompt in VS Code Desktop for the owner token](/images/editors/enter-password-for-ssh-connection-dark-theme.png)
![The password prompt in VS Code Desktop for the owner token](/images/editors/enter-password-for-ssh-connection-light-theme.png)

![Accessing the owner token string manually from the Gitpod dashboard](/images/editors/connect-via-ssh-dashboard-light-theme.png)
_Accessing the owner token string manually from the Gitpod dashboard_

> **Note:** Pattern of the owner token is: `user#password@host`

### How do I know whether I'm connecting to VS Code Desktop via Local Companion or SSH Gateway?

If you're unsure whether you're connecting via the local companion, or SSH Gateway approach, when connected to your Gitpod workspace, VS Code Desktop will show the connection host in the bottom left.

- **SSH Gateway** - `SSH: workspaceid.ssh.*.gitpod.io`
- **Local Companion**: `workspaceid` (no domain)

![The SSH host information shown in the bottom left of VS Code Desktop](/images/editors/show-ssh-connection-vscode-light-theme.png)
![The SSH host information shown in the bottom left of VS Code Desktop](/images/editors/show-ssh-connection-vscode-dark-theme.png)
_The SSH host information shown in the bottom left of VS Code Desktop_

### I'm being asked to choose the `platform of the remote host`. What should I choose?

When connecting, sometimes VS Code Desktop fails to automatically detect the host OS of a Gitpod workspace, asking the following: `Select the platform of the remote host "{id}"`.

No matter what the OS is on your computer, you should always choose `Linux` as the remote host platform, since this is the operating system all Gitpod workspaces run on.

If you choose another option, you may encounter an error like this:

```text
Resolver error: Error: Got bad result from install script
```

### I'm being prompted for a password/passphrase but VS Code Desktop cannot authenticate?

The owner token prompt and passphrase prompt in VS Code Desktop can look similar, however require different inputs. If you're seeing a failure to connect it could be you are using the incorrect authentication method, e.g. pasting an owner token for a passphrase, or vice versa.

1. **Owner token** - If the password prompt in VS Code Desktop asks `Enter password for workspace@\*.gitpod.io`, this prompt is for the owner token of the workspace, not the passphrase associated with your SSH key.

![The password prompt in VS Code Desktop for the owner token](/images/editors/enter-password-for-ssh-connection-dark-theme.png)
![The password prompt in VS Code Desktop for the owner token](/images/editors/enter-password-for-ssh-connection-light-theme.png)

![Accessing the owner token string manually from the Gitpod dashboard](/images/editors/connect-via-ssh-dashboard-light-theme.png)
_Accessing the owner token string manually from the Gitpod dashboard_

1. **SSH key Passphrase** - If your SSH key has a "passphrase" associated with the SSH key (it is not required for SSH keys), you'll need to enter your passphrase. If your public key has no passphrase, you should not see the passphrase prompt.

![Passphrase prompt from VS Code requiring the SSH key passphrase](/images/editors/enter-passphrase-for-ssh.png)
_Passphrase prompt from VS Code requiring the SSH key passphrase_

> **Note:** If you cannot remember your passphrase, consider creating a new SSH key and uploading the new key to Gitpod.

### How do I enable SSH agent forwarding for Desktop VSCode?

Gitpod extension delegates ssh connection to the [MS Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension so agent forwarding should just work if you configure it in your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```
Host *.gitpod.io
    ForwardAgent yes
```

## Upload Files

You can upload files to your workspace by dragging and dropping them into the editor. This method works with every IDE (e.g. Intellij, PyCharm, etc.)

  <figcaption>Upload Files from local to VS Code Desktop</figcaption>
</figure>

## Troubleshooting

If you are still having issues connecting to VS Code Desktop from Gitpod, try:

1. Checking your Gitpod VS Code Desktop extension version is using the latest version.
2. Attempt to directly connect via SSH using the `-v` to show verbose SSH logs. For example: `ssh -v workspacename@hostname`. You can find the `ssh` command in the workspace list on your Gitpod dashboard, see the [command-line](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/command-line) docs for more.
3. If you're a self-hosted customer, ensure [SSH Gateway](/docs/configure/user-settings/ssh) is configured correctly.

If you are still experiencing issues using VS Code Desktop and Gitpod, please [contact support](/support) with any related [troubleshooting logs](/docs/help/troubleshooting#gitpod-logs-in-vs-code-web-and-desktop)

**Important:** You must restart any started workspaces for your IDE preferences to take effect.

## Install Plugins

> This section relates to plugin management when using JetBrains IDEs in a remote development context. For information on regular plugin management, refer to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/managing-plugins.html" target="_blank">{title} docs</a>.

Unlike with regular development, JetBrains [Remote development](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/remote-development-overview.html#defs) with {title} allows users to install plugins in different locations:

- [**{title} backend plugins**](#install-on-title-backend) - The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality for IDE experiences relating to the filesystem, tools or languages and frameworks. When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start. It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.
- [**JetBrains Client plugins**](#install-on-jetbrains-client) - The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins are different to backend plugins as they contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes). Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).
- [**JetBrains Gateway plugins**](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway#getting-started) - The JetBrains Gateway is an application downloaded onto a users local machine which allows users to start JetBrains Clients that are compatible with the {title} backend, running in a Gitpod workspace. JetBrains Gateway plugins are installed directly in JetBrains Gateway and contribute to remote development connection experiences (e.g. the [Gitpod JetBrains Gateway](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18438-gitpod-gateway) plugin).

### Install on JetBrains Client

The JetBrains client runs on the users local machine and can be thought of as the user interface to the remote {title} backend. Client plugins contribute to the user interface aspect of the IDE experience (e.g. keyboard shortcuts and themes).

Once installed, **a client plugin is enabled for all Gitpod workspaces the user opens** (if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the plugin was initially installed).

To install a plugin on **JetBrains Client** follow these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on JetBrains Client" src="/images/editors/install-local-jb-plugin.png">
    <figcaption>Install a plugin on JetBrains Client</figcaption>
</figure>

### Install on {title} backend

The JetBrains {title} backend runs within the remote Gitpod workspace. Backend plugins contribute functionality requiring access to IDE experiences such as the remote filesystem (e.g. contributing support of languages and frameworks).

When installed, **a backend plugin only applies to the currently running Gitpod workspace** and is not associated with a user. However, a plugin can be [preconfigured for all users of a repository](#preconfigure-for-repository) so that the plugin is enabled with every workspace start.

It is not currently possible to install a backend plugin that applies to all workspaces of a Gitpod user or organization.

#### Install for your current workspace

You can install a plugin only for **your current workspace** following these steps:

- In **JetBrains Client** open the IDE settings and select **Plugins On Host**.
- Find the plugin in the **Marketplace** and click **Install**.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Install a plugin on {title} backend" src="/images/editors/install-remote-jb-plugin.png">
    <figcaption>Install a plugin on {title} backend</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Preconfigure for repository

> JetBrains plugin support is currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

You can share a plugin on **{title} backend** with everybody working on the repository by adding it to [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) and pushing to your Git repository.
Each workspace is preconfigured with plugins from the `gitpod.yml` configuration file. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  webstorm:
    plugins:
      - zielu.gittoolbox
      - izhangzhihao.rainbow.brackets
```

You can find the **pluginId** on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com) page:

- Find a page of the required plugin.
- Select the **Versions** tab.
- Click any version to copy the **pluginId** (short name such as `org.rust.lang`) of the plugin you want to install.

#### Install for your user

It is not yet possible to install plugins on **{title} backend** for your user to share across all your Gitpod workspaces.

## Configure JVM options

> Configuration of JVM options is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/8704).

You can adjust JVM options for {title} backend, especially if you want to increase the `-Xmx` memory size. For example:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  webstorm:
    vmoptions: "-Xmx4g"
```

For more detailed information on JVM options, refer to [Common JVM Options](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/tuning-the-ide.html#common-jvm-options) from JetBrains documentation.

## Configure IDE settings

> **Feedback needed:** The JetBrains Gitpod integration is currently beta. Gitpod [continues to collaborate with JetBrains](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-jetbrains). The below shows how you can configure global settings with JetBrains. To leave feedback on the approach, please see this GitHub issue: [#6576](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576). Also note that JetBrains is working on [comprehensive settings sync functionality](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RDCT-1/Settings-synchronization).

When running {title} locally, the JetBrains IDE applies [global settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/configuring-project-and-ide-settings.html) to all projects on your machine. However when running in a remote context using [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/integrations/jetbrains-gateway), it's important to note that some IDE settings are configured on the [JetBrains Client](#on-jetbrains-client) and others in the [{title} backend](#on-title-backend) running in your Gitpod [Workspace](/docs/configure/workspaces). See below instructions for more.

### On JetBrains Client

IDE Settings that are configured on the JetBrains Client are stored on your local machine and don't have `On Host` label in the IDE settings. These IDE settings are reused if the workspace is running the exact same version of the {title} backend where the settings were initially configured.

<figure>

    <figcaption>JetBrains client settings don't have <code>On Host</code> label.</figcaption>
</figure>

### On {title} backend

Settings configured on {title} backend are stored in a Gitpod workspace and have `On Host` label in the IDE settings.

### Configure IDE settings per project

Some IDE settings cannot be configured via [environment variables](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables#environment-variables) or through setting [vm options](#configure-jvm-options). These settings can only be set via the UI of JetBrains client, and must be manually copied to be syned between workspaces. The below steps detail how to configure your IDE settings for all the users of a given Gitpod project:

**Step 1: Manually use JetBrains UI to configure settings** - Set your IDE settings as you normally would, using the JetBrains UI.

**Step 2: Find generated IDE settings** - You will need to manually find any global settings generated by JetBrains backend within the following path: `/workspace/.config/JetBrains<-latest>/RemoteDev-WS/<your-project-name>/options`

**Step 3:** Move any relevant settings manually to a persistent location within your Gitpod project. Either via a [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image), or persisted in the version control of your project, for example by committing settings data to GitHub.

**Include relevant IDE settings in your Workspace Image**

- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/home/gitpod/.gitpod/jetbrains/webstorm/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

**Commit relevant IDE settings to source control**

- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/options` - This location applies settings to all JetBrains products (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLang, etc).
- `/workspace/<your-project-name>/.gitpod/jetbrains/webstorm/options` - This location will apply settings only to the given IDE, e.g. {title}.

For any further changes to your IDE settings, you will need to follow the above steps again.

> **Note:** When locating and applying IDE settings, Gitpod will read the locations specified above in priority order. The locations specified first are overriden by the locations specified later.

### Configure IDE settings per user

To configure IDE settings for your user only, and not all those using a project.

Follow the instructions for [configuring IDE settings per project](#configure-ide-settings-per-project), but instead use [.dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles#dotfiles) rather than a workspace image or source control to store your IDE settings.

## Indexing using Prebuilds

> JetBrains Prebuilds is currently in [Alpha](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

When you open the project {title} starts indexing to load modules and
enable the core functionality like code completion and navigation.
Depending on the size of your project indexing speed can vary significantly.

You can speed up the indexing of a project by applying these [general recommendations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/indexing.html).
Gitpod prebuilds allow you to improve it further by indexing before you start a new workspace.

To leverage it:

- configure prebuilds for your repository, refer to [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds);
- enable indexing for {title} in prebuilds by editing [.gitpod.yml](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) in your repository:

```yaml
jetbrains:
  webstorm:
    prebuilds:
      version: stable
```

- push changes to your Git repository to apply.

The `version` property allows you to control whether to index for `stable`, `latest`, or `both` versions of {title} compatible with Gitpod.
Users can switch between `stable` and `latest` versions of {title} on the [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) page.

## Workspace performance

When using a Gitpod workspace you might experience performance issues caused by:

- An application using more resources than expected
- Resource consumption in adjacent containers running on the workspace node.

In your JetBrains IDE within the JetBrains Gateway [Backend Control Center](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-inside-remote-project.html#control_center) you can find two metrics relating to your running workspace: `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory`.

The remaining metrics you can find in the Backend Control Center regarding the node that your workspace is running on, and not the workspace itself.

> **Note:** Performance information shown in the Backend Control Center is the same as the information that is shown when running the command [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top) in your workspace, see the [Command Line Interface](/docs/references/gitpod-cli) documentation for more.

![jetbrains performance](/images/jetbrains-gateway/jetbrains-performance-center.png)

## FAQs

- For the questions about supported IDEs and Editors in Gitpod, refer to [FAQs](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/faqs).

- For the general questions about JetBrains Remote Development, refer to refer to the general IDE <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/faq-about-remote-development.html" target="_blank">{title} FAQ</a>.

### Are there any JetBrains optimizations I can make if my workspace is slow?

Debugging performance can be challenging, as performance issues can depend on many factors such as how Gitpod is configured (if you're operating Gitpod on Self-Hosted). However, there are some ways you can gather performance information and optimise your JetBrains IDE setup with Gitpod:

1. Firstly, to gather information on performance, you can [view workspace performance metrics from within the IDE](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij#workspace-performance) in the Backend Control Center, or by using [`gp top`](/docs/references/gitpod-cli#top).
2. You may also want to try adjusting the Max Heap Size allocated to the JetBrains Backend in the Settings tab of the Backend Control Center. If updating this setting helps your performance, you can set the `vmoptions` value for your JetBrains IDE in your `.gitpod.yml`.

> **Note:** If the performance metrics show that your workspace is hitting its resource limits, and you are using Gitpod Self-Hosted, it might make sense to consider changing the resource configuration for your workspaces. This can be done via a [config-patch](/docs/configure/self-hosted/latest/config-patches). Configuring workspace resources is not yet available on SaaS.

# February Release 2019 🎉

We are close to leaving the beta phase and with that are also approaching a more regular release schedule.
This means we are going to have monthly release notes. They will pop up only once and you can easily dismiss them by pressing <kbd>[ESC]</kbd>.
If you want to look up the release notes later you can open them through the command palette <kbd>[F1]</kbd>. Simply search for 'Release Notes'.

So here are the new & noteworthy things that we have been hard at work at this time.

## GitHub Links

You can now navigate to GitHub directly from the editor. The GitHub URL of any editor position or selection can be accessed with a right-click, and used for example in GitHub issues or Pull Request comments to reference interesting code locations.

![GitHub Links](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-02-15/github-navi.jpg)

## Snapshots

In addition to live sharing a running Gitpod workspace, you can now take a snapshot. Snapshots capture the current state of a workspace session including the UI layout and the file changes. Anyone who has a snapshot link can create a fresh workspace based on that.

This is super handy for providing reproducibles in GitHub issues and StackOverflow posts. They are also great to prepare trainigs, tutorials, or just to showcase stuff you have thrown together.

Please see this [blog post](https://medium.com/gitpod/code-never-lies-creating-reproducibles-for-any-programming-language-7946021a68f2) as well as the [documentation](/docs/configure/workspaces/collaboration#sharing-snapshots) for more details.

![Snapshot](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-02-15/snapshots.png)

## Configuration

The possibilities to fine-tune the developer experience when using Gitpod on your repository have been improved. Here are the features you can define in your `.gitpod.yml`:

### Tasks

You can now specify multiple tasks. Each task will have its own terminal view on start. You can even specify where those terminals whould be opened.
The following config, for instance, will make sure that two terminals are opened next to each other.

```yaml
tasks:
  - command: echo 'left'
  - command: echo 'right'
    openMode: split-right
```

![Split Terminals](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-02-15/terminal-split.png)

### Lifecycles

In addition we have introduced multiple lifecycle phases for the tasks, such as [init](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks#init-command) and [before](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks#before-command). The main purpose is to avoid rerunning unnecessary commands such as full builds, when restarting workspaces or opening snapshots.

Check the table below for an overview of the different starting scenarios.

<div class="overflow-x-auto">

| Start Mode        | Execution                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Fresh Workspace   | `before && init && command` |
| Restart Workspace | `before && command`         |
| Snapshot          | `before && command`         |

</div>

### Ports

You can now specify the default behavior on port detection. By default users get a notification when starting a server, asking whether they want to open a web view or an external browser.

This behavior can now be pre-configured so users are not bothered with annoying notifications. Here is an example where we configure port `8080` to automatically open in a web preview pane:

```yaml
ports:
  - port: 8080
    onOpen: open-preview
```

Check out [the docs](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) to learn more about pre-configuring things in Gitpod.

## YAML Support

Gitpod now understands YAML syntax and uses json schema specifications to validate and guide developers. While this works for any YAML files it comes in especially handy when editing `.gitpod.yml`.

![yaml in action](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-02-15/yaml-support.png)

## Gitpod CLI

The CLI for Gitpod has learned new tricks. Check out all the cool things you can do with it by typing `gp help`.

Here are the new commands we added:

### gp init

To get the best experience with Gitpod, you should configure your repository to have the right tools, run the right commands on start, etc. This information is stored in a `.gitpod.yml` file sitting in your repository.

The `gp init` command walks you through the basic setup and generates a `.gitpod.yml` and if desired a corresponding `Dockerfile`.

```sh
gitpod /workspace/my-repo $ gp init
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Workspace Docker image:
  ▸ default
    custom image
    docker file
```

More information about writing `.gitpod.yml` configurations can be found in [the docs](/docs/configure).

### gp url

One of the things you do in a `.gitpod.yml` is declaring the exposed ports. Gitpod maps them to a specific subdomain in order to make them accessible. For instance if you have a dev server running on `0.0.0.0:3000` the `gp url` command gives you the external url for that service.

Here is an example:

```sh
gitpod /workspace/release-notes $ gp url 3000
https://3000-b33f605e-b32a-4e44-ae5a-acad9641de0a.ws-eu0.gitpod.io/
```

`gp url` can also give you the URL of the workspace itself:

```sh
gitpod /workspace/release-notes $ gp url
https://b33f605e-b32a-4e44-ae5a-acad9641de0a.ws-eu0.gitpod.io/
```

### gp preview

`gp preview` is similar to `gp open`, except that it does not open a file in the editor but a URL in a preview pane on the right.

This is especially handy together with `gp url` if you want to open a specific path from a script.

Here's an example:

```sh
gp preview $(gp url 3000)my/special/path.html
```

## Improved Docker Performance

In addition to the `.gitpod.yml` you can provide a `Dockerfile` which is automatically picked up by Gitpod. See [this blog post](https://medium.com/gitpod/bring-your-own-docker-image-to-gitpod-52db1aa861de) for more information on setting up a Dockerfile for your project.

For example, here is a Dockerfile that allows developing native UI applications in Go on Gitpod:

```sh
FROM gitpod/workspace-full-vnc
RUN sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev && \
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Since we launched this feature, the performance and logging for docker builds have also been improved significantly.

## Status Page

As we continuously improve and expand Gitpod, there are times when things inevitably don't go as planned, occasionally causing downtime. If you're ever curious about the status of [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io), or you'd like to follow how we resolve an incident, we made [status.gitpod.io](https://status.gitpod.io/) just for you.

In fact, thanks to [Statusfy](https://github.com/bazzite/statusfy), it took us just a few hours to build an entire [open source status page](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod-status). Learn more about this short adventure in [this blog post](https://medium.com/gitpod/status-update-gitpod-%EF%B8%8F-statusfy-ed8266d63a20).

## Java Debugging

In addition to Node.js one can now also launch and debug Java applications directly from within the editor. Code lense actions on `main()` methods will automatically use the right classpath from the current project settings (based on maven, gradle or eclipse classpath information).

Launch configs are stored in a VS Code compatible `launch.json` file.

![Debug Java](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-02-15/debug-java.jpg)

## XML Support

The new improved XML support not only does syntax highlighting for XML and XSD but also uses associated schemas to provide diagnostics, content assist and hover information.

![XML Support](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-02-15/xml-support.png)

## Better Previews

Previews can now easily be opened by clicking on the top right icon (![icon](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-02-15/icon.jpg)) on any previewable files, such as Markdown, HTML and SVG files.

The inverse is supported, too. I.e. clicking the file icon on the top right of a preview will open the corresponding editor on the left. For Markdown even scrolling is synced between the two views.

## AsciiDoc Support

In addition to Markdown, Gitpod now also supports previewing AsciiDoc as you type.

# April 2019

Today we are happy to announce that we are moving out of beta.
We want to thank all the beta testers who have provided great feedback. Gitpod wouldn't be what it is without you! ❤️

You can read more about the announcement in [the blog post](/blog/gitpod-launch).

Besides a complete relaunch of the website and app, we have added some very exciting new features:

## GitHub App / Prebuilt Workspaces 🚀

We have been busy developing a <a href="https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io" target="_blank">new GitHub app</a>, that once installed on your repository will prebuild your project on every push.
On GitHub pull requests this is communicated through a status check.

![Prebuilt Check on PR](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-04-05/prebuilt-check.png)

As a result, Gitpod is now the first IDE that builds your project, before you open it.

Read more about this exciting feature in [the docs](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) and in [Chris' blog post](/blog/prebuilds).

## Better `localhost` Handling

When starting web servers in Gitpod, often times you need to explicitly make sure the dev server allows connections from non-localhost.
Starting today, you no longer need to worry about that. Gitpod now forwards the port locally and rewrites the host headers,
so that dev servers will be fine.

## Better Go Support

Gitpod now directly uses Microsoft's great Go support for VS Code.

![VS Code Go Extension](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-04-05/vscode-go.png)

## Unlimited Hours

If you don't feel comfortable with a time-based limit, you can now purchase the 'Unlimited' plan to use Gitpod as much as you like on public and private repositories.

We also offer [unlimited plans for teams](https://gitpod.io/teams/), and [for students](/pricing) the price for an unlimited plan is only 9$ or 8€.

> If you have created your account during the beta, i.e. before April 5th, you will be able to work on private repositories for free for another month, on us.

You can check out the various [pricing options on the website](/pricing).

## New Design 💄

As part of the launch, we have refreshed the design of Gitpod. The website and dashboard now use a new dark theme that we hope you'll like, and the UI of the
IDE is more closely matching the look of VS Code.

![New Dashboard](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-04-05/dashboard-design.png)

## Delete Workspace

You can now delete workspaces in the dashboard. Please note that deletion can not be reversed as we are really
deleting all the contents of your workspace.

You can also delete your entire account (hopefully the least used feature).

## Many Small Improvements

Besides these bigger features, we have fixed many bugs and improved the performance and user experience of Gitpod.
We have merged 146 PRs in Gitpod and <a href="https://github.com/theia-ide/theia/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A%3E2019-02-05+" target="_blank">206 in Theia</a>.

## What's next?

With this release we have already added some VS Code extensions. Going forward we will double down on the integration.
We are looking at one programming language after the other, making sure the experience is excellent and the VS Code extensions
work as expected. Once we've reached a state where we are confident VS Code extensions work reliably in general, we will allow users to install them.
Furthermore, we are focusing on start-up time improvements and, of course, bug-fixing and offering you a great development experience.

# June 2019

After the public launch of Gitpod.io in April, we have spent most of our time on changing our internal architecture to better scale and improve the cloud density as well
as supporting VS Code extension. Although this work is not yet finished, we have added a bunch of new features on the way, which are listed below.

## Toggle Maximize

Simple but useful: Double-clicking a tab will maximize the corresponding panel.

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Toggle Maximize" src="/images/docs/release-notes/2019-06-17/maximize.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>Toggle Maximize</figcaption>
</figure>

## Links in terminals

You can now follow links and open files from the terminal by clicking on the respective links.

![Terminal Links](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-06-17/terminal-link.png)

## Environment Variables

Gitpod allows users to inject environment variables into workspaces. Based on a simple pattern against the repository name
one can filter which env vars are actually injected. Also please note that all environment variable values are encrypted before stored in the database.

In addition to user-based environment variables, you can pass environment variables through the context link on start.
See the [docs](/docs/configure/projects/environment-variables) for more information.

## Bi-directional Scroll Sync

When editing Markdown files it is very convenient to see the preview next to the editor. You can open a preview by click the icon on the top right of the editor.
Now you can scroll both the editor or the preview and see how the other part is scrolling with it, showing the corresponding sections.

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Scroll sync" src="/images/docs/release-notes/2019-06-17/scroll-sync.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>Scroll sync</figcaption>
</figure>

Contributed through [PR #5442](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia/pull/5442).

## Better Rust support

In addition to the Go VS Code extension, Gitpod now also runs the official [Rust VS Code extensions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls-vscode).
So expect faster and more reliable support for Rust.

## Emmet support

Gitpod comes with support for emmet, a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow.
Among other things it allows to quickly generate html boilerplate using shortcuts.

![Emmet](../../../../../static/images/docs/release-notes/2019-06-17/emmet.png)
See the [cheat-sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) for a quick overview of what's supported.

## Debugging in Java

The debugging of Java applications had a problem in that it the process would pick a wrong java executable when launching processes.
This is now fixed.

## Better Upload

You can now upload large files through drag and drop and see proper progress information on the top of the window.

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="upload" src="/images/docs/release-notes/2019-06-17/upload.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>upload</figcaption>
</figure>

## Improved C++ Language Support

We have upgrade the language services to use the latest clangd version.

## Better Git Amend

The git amend UI has been improved so that you can amend / squash multiple commits but also
undo that.

<figure>
<video controls playsinline autoplay loop muted class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Git amend" src="/images/docs/release-notes/2019-06-17/git-amend.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
    <figcaption>Git amend</figcaption>
</figure>

Also the entire SCM widget has been rewritten to match VS Code's UX.

## Config: Port ranges

In your `.gitpod.yml` one can now specify [port ranges](/docs/configure/workspaces/ports#port-ranges), so you can manage antire ranges addition
and tell Gitpod what to do when a service opens on one of those ports.

## CLI: _gp await-port_

The cli learned a new thing, that let's you wait for a certain port to open.
This is useful if you want to wait for a certain path and then take a specific action.

Here's an example that will open a certain path in the preview once a service is a available port 3000:

```sh
gp await-port 3000 && gp preview $(gp url 3000)my/path/index.html
```

## Many Small Improvements

Besides these bigger features, we have fixed many bugs and improved the performance and user experience of Gitpod.
We have merged 146 PRs in Gitpod and [220 in Theia](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A%3E2019-04-01+).

## What's next?

With this release we have added some additional VS Code extensions.
The upcoming release will allow you to install arbitrary VS Code extensions and add that as configuration to your `.gitpod.yml` files.
The GitLab integration as well as a easy-to-install, Self-Hosted version of Gitpod is in the works.
Finally, we are looking into optimizing start-up time improvements and, of course, bug-fixing and offering you a great development experience.
